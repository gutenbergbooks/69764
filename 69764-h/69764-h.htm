<p class="blkquot">It is to our immortal countryman; Bacon, that we owe the
broad announcement of this grand and fertile principle; and the
developement of the idea, that the whole of natural philosophy
consists entirely of a series of inductive generalizations,
commencing with the most circumstantially stated particulars, and
carried up to universal laws, or axioms, which comprehend in
their statements every subordinate degree of generality; and of
a corresponding series of inverted reasoning from generals to
particulars, by which these axioms are traced back into their
remotest consequences, and all particular propositions deduced
from them; as well those by whose immediate considerations we
rose to their discovery, as those of which we had no previous
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Even</span> if Bacon’s <i>Novum Organon</i> had possessed the
character to which it aspired as completely as was
possible in its own day, it would at present need renovation:
and even if no such book had ever been written, it would be
a worthy undertaking to determine
the machinery, intellectual, social and material, by
which human knowledge can best be augmented.
Bacon could only divine how sciences might be constructed;
we can trace, in their history, how their
construction has taken place. However sagacious were
his conjectures, the facts which have really occurred
must give additional instruction: however large were
his anticipations, the actual progress of science since
his time has illustrated them in all their extent. And
as to the structure and operation of the <em>Organ</em> by
which truth is to be collected from nature,&mdash;that is,
the Methods by which science is to be promoted&mdash;we
know that, though Bacon’s general maxims are sagacious
and animating, his particular precepts failed in
his hands, and are now practically useless. This,
perhaps, was not wonderful, seeing that they were, as
I have said, mainly derived from conjectures respecting
knowledge and the progress of knowledge; but
at <span class="pagenum" id="pageiv">iv</span>
the present day, when, in several provinces of knowledge,
we have a large actual progress of solid truth
to look back upon, we may make the like attempt
with the prospect of better success, at least on that
ground. It may be a task, not hopeless, to extract
from the past progress of science the elements of an
effectual and substantial method of Scientific Discovery.
The advances which have, during the last three
centuries, been made in the physical sciences;&mdash;in
Astronomy, in Physics, in Chemistry, in Natural History,
in Physiology;&mdash;these are allowed by all to be
real, to be great, to be striking; may it not be that
the steps of progress in these different cases have in
them something alike? May it not be that in each
advancing movement of such knowledge there is some
common principle, some common process? May it
not be that discoveries are made by an <em>Organ</em> which
has something uniform in its working? If we can
shew that this is so, we shall have the <em>New Organ</em>,
which Bacon aspired to construct, <em>renovated</em> according
to our advanced intellectual position and office.</p>
<p>It was with the view of opening the way to such
an attempt that I undertook that survey of the past
progress of physical knowledge, of which I have given
the results in the <i>History of the Sciences</i>, and the
<i>History of Scientific Ideas</i><a id="fnanchor1-P" href="#note1-P"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>;
the former containing
the history of the sciences, so far as it depends on
<span class="pagenum" id="pagev">v</span>
observed <em>Facts</em>; the latter containing the history of
those <em>Ideas</em> by which such Facts are bound into
Theories.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note1-P" href="#fnanchor1-P">1</a></span> Published in
two former editions as part of the <i>Philosophy of the
Inductive Sciences</i> (b. i&ndash;x.).
</div>
<p>It can hardly happen that a work which treats of
Methods of Scientific Discovery, shall not seem to
fail in the positive results which it offers. For an
Art of Discovery is not possible. At each step of the
investigation are needed Invention, Sagacity, Genius,&mdash;elements
which no art can give. We may hope in
vain, as Bacon hoped, for an Organ which shall enable
all men to construct Scientific Truths, as a pair of
compasses enables all men to construct exact
circles<a id="fnanchor2-P" href="#note2-P"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>.
This cannot be. The practical results of the Philosophy of Science
must be rather classification and
analysis of what has been done, than precept and
method for future doing. Yet I think that the methods of discovery
which I have to recommend, though
gathered from a wider survey of scientific history,
both as to subjects and as to time, than (so far as I am
aware) has been elsewhere attempted, are quite as
definite and practical as any others which have been
proposed; with the great additional advantage of being
the methods by which all great discoveries in science
have really been made. This may be said, for instance,
of <i>the Method of Gradation</i> and <i>the Method of Natural
Classification</i>, spoken of <a href="#page220">b. iii. c. viii</a>; and in a narrower
sense, of <i>the Method of Curves</i>, <i>the Method
of</i> <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi">vi</span>
<i>Means</i>, <i>the Method of Least Squares</i> and <i>the Method
of Residues</i>, spoken of in <a href="#page202">chap. vii.</a> of the same Book.
Also the Remarks on the <i>Use of Hypotheses</i> and on
the <i>Tests of Hypotheses</i> (<a href="#page186">b. ii. c. v.</a>) point out features
which mark the usual course of discovery.</p>

</div>
<p>But one of the principal lessons resulting from our
views is undoubtedly this:&mdash;that different sciences
may be expected to advance by different modes of
procedure, according to their present condition; and
that in many of these sciences, an Induction performed
by any of the methods which have just been referred
to is not the next step which we may expect to see
made. Several of the sciences may not be in a condition
which fits them for such a <i>Colligation of Facts</i>;
(to use the phraseology to which the succeeding analysis
has led me). The Facts may, at the present
time, require to be more fully observed, or the Idea
by which they are to be colligated may require to be
more fully unfolded.</p>
<p>But in this point also, our speculations are far from
being barren of practical results. The examination
to which we have subjected each science, gives us the
means of discerning whether what is needed for the
further progress of the science, has its place in the
Observations, or in the Ideas, or in the union of the
two. If observations be wanted, the Methods of Observation,
given in <a href="#page145">b. iii. c. ii.</a> may be referred to. If
those who are to make the next discoveries need, for
that purpose, a developement of their Ideas, the modes
in which such a developement has usually taken <span class="pagenum" id="pagevii">vii</span>
place are treated of in Chapters <a href="#page164">iii.</a> and <a href="#page180">iv.</a>
of that Book.</p>
<p>No one who has well studied the history of science
can fail to see how important a part of that history
is the explication, or as I might call it, the <i>clarification</i>
of men’s Ideas. This, the metaphysical aspect of
each of the physical sciences, is very far from being,
as some have tried to teach, an aspect which it passes
through at an early period of progress, and previously
to the stage of positive knowledge. On the contrary,
the metaphysical movement is a necessary part of the
inductive movement. This, which is evidently so by
the nature of the case, was proved by a copious collection
of historical evidences, in the <i>History of Scientific
Ideas</i>. The ten Books of that History contain an
account of the principal philosophical controversies
which have taken place in all the physical sciences,
from Mathematics to Physiology. These controversies,
which must be called <i>metaphysical</i> if anything be so
called, have been conducted by the greatest discoverers
in each science, and have been an essential part of the
discoveries made. Physical discoverers have differed
from barren speculators, not by having <em>no</em> metaphysics
in their heads, but by having <em>good</em> metaphysics in
their heads while their adversaries had bad; and by
binding their metaphysics to their physics, instead of
keeping the two asunder. I trust that the <i>History of
Scientific Ideas</i> is of some value, even as a record of a
number of remarkable controversies; but I conceive
that it also contains an indisputable proof that
there <span class="pagenum" id="pageviii">viii</span>
is, in progressive science, a metaphysical as well as a
physical element;&mdash;ideas as well as facts;&mdash;thoughts
as well as things. Metaphysics is the process of ascertaining
that thought is consistent with itself: and
if it be not so, our supposed knowledge is not knowledge.</p>
<p>In <a href="#page97">Chapter vi.</a> of the Second Book, I have spoken of
<i>the Logic of Induction</i>. Several
writers<a id="fnanchor3-P" href="#note3-P"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> have quoted
very emphatically my assertion that the Logic of Induction
does not exist in previous writers: using it as an
introduction to Logical Schemes of their own. They
seem to have overlooked the fact that at the same time
that I noted the deficiency, I offered a scheme which I
think fitted to supply this want. And I am obliged to
say that I do not regard the schemes proposed by any
of those gentlemen as at all satisfactory for the purpose.
But I must defer to a future occasion any criticism of
authors who have written on the subjects here treated.
A critical notice of such authors formed the Twelfth
Book of the former edition of the <i>Philosophy of the
Sciences</i>. I have there examined the opinions concerning
the Nature of Real Knowledge and the mode of
acquiring it, which have been promulgated in all ages,
from Plato and Aristotle, to Roger Bacon, to Francis
Bacon, to Newton, to Herschel. Such a survey, with
the additions which I should now have to make to it,
may hereafter be put forth as a separate book:
but I <span class="pagenum" id="pageix">ix</span>
have endeavoured to confine the present volume to such
positive teaching regarding Knowledge and Science as
results from the investigations pursued in the other
works of this series. But with regard to this matter,
of the <i>Logic of Induction</i>, I may venture to say, that
we shall not find anything deserving the name explained
in the common writers on Logic, or exhibited
under the ordinary Logical Forms. <em>That</em> in previous
writers which comes the nearest to the notice of such a
Logic as the history of science has suggested and verified,
is the striking declaration of Bacon in two of his
Aphorisms (b. i. aph. civ. cv.).</p>

</div>
<p>“There will be good hopes for the Sciences then,
and not till then, when by a true <span class="sc">scale</span> or Ladder,
and by successive steps, following continuously without
gaps or breaks, men shall ascend from particulars to
the narrower Propositions, from those to intermediate
ones, rising in order one above another, and at last to
the most general.</p>
<p>“But in establishing such propositions, we must devise
some other <span class="sc">Form of Induction</span> than has hitherto
been in use; and this must be one which serves not
only to prove and discover <em>Principles</em>, (as very general
Propositions are called,) but also the narrower and the
intermediate, and in short, all true Propositions.”</p>
<p>And he elsewhere speaks of successive <span class="sc">Floors</span> of
Induction.</p>
<p>All the truths of an extensive science form a Series
of such Floors, connected by such Scales or Ladders;
and a part of the Logic of Induction consists, as
I <span class="pagenum" id="pagex">x</span>
conceive, in the construction of a <em>Scheme</em> of such
Floors. Converging from a wide basis of various
classes of particulars, at last to one or a few general
truths, these schemes necessarily take the shape of
a Pyramid. I have constructed such Pyramids for
Astronomy and for Optics<a id="fnanchor4-P" href="#note4-P"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>;
and the illustrious Von
Humboldt in speaking of the former subject, does me
the honour to say that my attempt in that department
is perfectly successful<a id="fnanchor5-P" href="#note5-P"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>.
The Logic of Induction
contains other portions, which may be seen in the
following work, <a href="#page97">b. ii. c. vi.</a></p>

</div>
<p>I have made large additions to the present edition,
especially in what regards the Application of Science,
(<a href="#page233">b. iii. c. ix.</a>) and the Language of Science. The
former subject I am aware that I have treated very
imperfectly. It would indeed, of itself, furnish material
for a large work; and would require an acquaintance
with practical arts and manufactures of the most
exact and extensive kind. But even a general observer
may see how much more close the union of Art
with Science is now than it ever was before; and what
large and animating hopes this union inspires, both
for the progress of Art and of Science. On another
subject also I might have dilated to a great extent,&mdash;what
I may call (as I have just now called it) the
<i>social</i> machinery for the advancement of science. There
can be no doubt that at certain stages of
sciences, <span class="pagenum" id="pagexi">xi</span>
Societies and Associations may do much to promote
their further progress; by combining their observations,
comparing their views, contributing to provide
material means of observation and calculation, and
dividing the offices of observer and generalizer. We
have had in Europe in general, and especially in this
country, very encouraging examples of what may be
done by such Associations. For the present I have
only ventured to propound one Aphorism on the subject,
namely this; (Aph. LV.) That it is worth considering
whether a continued and connected system of
observation and calculation, like that of Astronomy,
might not be employed in improving our knowledge
of other subjects; as Tides, Currents, Winds, Clouds,
Rain, Terrestrial Magnetism, Aurora Borealis, composition
of crystals, and the like. In saying this, I have
mentioned those subjects which are, as appears to
me, most likely to profit by continued and connected
observations.</p>
<p>I have thrown the substance of my results into
Aphorisms, as Bacon had done in his <i>Novum Organum</i>.
This I have done, not in the way of delivering dogmatic
assertions or oracular sentences; for
the Aphorisms are all supported by reasoning, and
were, in fact, written after the reasoning, and extracted
from it. I have adopted this mode of gathering results
into compact sentences, because it seems to
convey lessons with additional clearness and emphasis.</p>
<p>I have only to repeat what I have already said; that
this task of adapting the <i>Novum Organum</i> to
the <span class="pagenum" id="pagexii">xii</span>
present state of Physical Science, and of constructing a
<i>Newer Organ</i> which may answer the purposes at which
Bacon aimed, seems to belong to the present generation;
and being here founded upon a survey of the
past history and present condition of the Physical
Sciences, will I hope, not be deemed presumptuous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> name <i>Organon</i> was applied to the works of
Aristotle which treated of Logic, that is, of the method
of establishing and proving knowledge, and of refuting
errour, by means of Syllogisms. Francis Bacon, holding
that this method was insufficient and futile for
the augmentation of real and useful knowledge, published
his <i>Novum Organon</i>, in which he proposed for
that purpose methods from which he promised a better
success. Since his time real and useful knowledge has
made great progress, and many Sciences have been
greatly extended or newly constructed; so that even
if Bacon’s method had been the right one, and had
been complete as far as the progress of Science up to
his time could direct it, there would be room for the
revision and improvement of the methods of arriving
at scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as we have gone through the <i>Histories</i>
of the principal <i>Sciences</i>, from the earliest up to the
present time, in a previous work, and have also traced
the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i> in another work, it
may perhaps be regarded as not too presumptuous if
we attempt this revision and improvement of the
methods by which Sciences must rise and grow.
This <span class="pagenum" id="page4">4</span>
is our task in the present volume; and to mark the
reference of this undertaking to the work of Bacon, we
name our book <i>Novum Organon Renovatum</i>.</p>
<p class="end">Bacon has delivered his precepts in Aphorisms,
some of them stated nakedly, others expanded into
dissertations. The general results at which we have
arrived by tracing the history of Scientific Ideas are
the groundwork of such Precepts as we have to give:
and I shall therefore begin by summing up these
results in Aphorisms, referring to the former work
for the historical proof that these Aphorisms are true.</p>

<p><i>MAN is the Interpreter of Nature, Science the right
interpretation.</i> (<i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>:
Book <span class="sc">i.</span> Chapter 1.)</p>
<p class="center">II.</p>
<p><i>The</i> Senses <i>place before us the</i> Characters <i>of the Book
of Nature; but these convey no knowledge to us, till we
have discovered the Alphabet by which they are to be read.</i>
(Ibid. <span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center" id="b1a3">III.</p>
<p><i>The</i> Alphabet, <i>by means of which we interpret Phenomena,
consists of the</i> Ideas <i>existing in our own minds; for
these give to the phenomena that coherence and significance
which is not an object of sense.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">IV.</p>
<p><i>The antithesis of</i> Sense <i>and</i> Ideas <i>is the foundation of
the Philosophy of Science. No knowledge can exist without
the union, no philosophy without the separation, of these two
elements.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)
<span class="pagenum" id="page6">6</span></p>
<p class="center">V.</p>
<p>Fact <i>and</i> Theory <i>correspond to Sense on the one hand,
and to Ideas on the other, so far as we are</i> conscious <i>of our
Ideas: but all facts involve ideas</i> unconsciously; <i>and thus
the distinction of Facts and Theories is not tenable, as that
of Sense and Ideas is.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">VI.</p>
<p><i>Sensations and Ideas in our knowledge are like Matter
and Form in bodies. Matter cannot exist without Form,
nor Form without Matter: yet the two are altogether distinct
and opposite. There is no possibility either of separating,
or of confounding them. The same is the case with
Sensations and Ideas.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">VII.</p>
<p><i>Ideas are not</i> trans<i>formed, but</i> in<i>formed Sensations; for
without ideas, sensations have no form.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">VIII.</p>
<p><i>The Sensations are the</i> Objective, <i>the Ideas the</i> Subjective
<i>part of every act of perception or knowledge.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">IX.</p>
<p><i>General Terms denote</i> Ideal Conceptions, <i>as a</i> circle, <i>an</i>
orbit, <i>a</i> rose. <i>These are not</i> Images <i>of real things, as was
held by the Realists, but Conceptions: yet they are conceptions, not bound
together by mere</i> Name, <i>as the Nominalists
held, but by an Idea.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">X.</p>
<p><i>It has been said by some, that all Conceptions are merely</i>
states <i>or</i> feelings of the mind, <i>but this assertion only tends
to confound what it is our business to distinguish.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">XI.</p>
<p><i>Observed Facts are connected so as to produce new truths,
by superinducing upon them an Idea: and such truths are
obtained</i> by Induction. (<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)
<span class="pagenum" id="page7">7</span></p>
<p class="center">XII.</p>
<p><i>Truths once obtained by legitimate Induction are Facts:
these Facts may be again connected, so as to produce higher
truths: and thus we advance to</i> Successive Generalizations.
(<span class="sc">i.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">XIII.</p>
<p><i>Truths obtained by Induction are made compact and
permanent by being expressed in</i> Technical Terms. (<span class="sc">i.</span> 3.)</p>
<p class="center">XIV.</p>
<p><i>Experience cannot conduct us to universal and necessary
truths:&mdash;Not to universal, because she has not tried all
cases:&mdash;Not to necessary, because necessity is not a matter
to which experience can testify.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 5.)</p>
<p class="center">XV.</p>
<p><i>Necessary truths derive their necessity from the</i> Ideas
<i>which they involve; and the existence of necessary truths
proves the existence of Ideas not generated by experience.</i>
(<span class="sc">i.</span> 5.)</p>
<p class="center">XVI.</p>
<p><i>In Deductive Reasoning, we cannot have any truth in
the conclusion which is not virtually contained in the
premises.</i> (<span class="sc">i.</span> 6.)</p>
<p class="center">XVII.</p>
<p><i>In order to acquire any exact and solid knowledge, the
student must possess with perfect precision the ideas
appropriate to that part of knowledge: and this precision is
tested by the student’s</i> perceiving <i>the axiomatic evidence of
the</i> axioms <i>belonging to each</i> Fundamental Idea. (<span class="sc">i.</span> 6.)</p>
<p class="center">XVIII.</p>
<p><i>The Fundamental Ideas which it is most important to
consider, as being the Bases of the Material Sciences, are the
Ideas of</i> Space, Time (<i>including Number</i>), Cause
(<i>including Force and Matter</i>), Outness <i>of Objects, and</i> Media <i>of
Perception of Secondary Qualities,</i> Polarity (<i>Contrariety</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="page8">8</span>
<i>Chemical</i> Composition <i>and</i> Affinity, Substance, Likeness
<i>and Natural</i> Affinity, Means and Ends (<i>whence the Notion
of Organization</i>), Symmetry, <i>and the Ideas of</i> Vital Powers.
(<span class="sc">i.</span> 8.)</p>
<p class="center">XIX.</p>
<p><i>The Sciences which depend upon the Ideas of Space and
Number are</i> Pure <i>Sciences, not</i> Inductive <i>Sciences: they do
not infer special Theories from Facts, but deduce the conditions
of all theory from Ideas. The Elementary Pure
Sciences, or Elementary Mathematics, are Geometry, Theoretical
Arithmetic and Algebra.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 1.)</p>
<p class="center">XX.</p>
<p><i>The Ideas on which the Pure Sciences depend, are those
of</i> Space <i>and</i> Number; <i>but Number is a modification of
the conception of Repetition, which belongs to the Idea of</i>
Time. (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 1.)</p>
<p class="center">XXI.</p>
<p><i>The</i> Idea of Space <i>is not derived from experience, for
experience of external objects</i> pre<i>supposes bodies to exist in
Space, Space is a condition under which the mind receives
the impressions of sense, and therefore the relations of space
are necessarily and universally true of all perceived objects.
Space is a</i> form <i>of our perceptions, and regulates them,
whatever the</i> matter <i>of them may be.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 2.)</p>
<p class="center">XXII.</p>
<p><i>Space is not a General Notion collected by abstraction
from particular cases; for we do not speak of</i> Spaces <i>in
general, but of universal or absolute</i> Space. <i>Absolute Space
is infinite. All special spaces are</i> in <i>absolute space, and are
parts of it.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 3.)</p>
<p class="center">XXIII.</p>
<p><i>Space is not a real object or thing, distinct from the

<p><i>The Idea of Space is exhibited for scientific purposes, by
the</i> Definitions <i>and</i> Axioms <i>of Geometry; such, for instance,

Definition of Parallel Lines, <i>and the</i> Axiom <i>concerning them;&mdash;the</i>
Axiom <i>that</i> two straight lines cannot
inclose a space. <i>These Definitions are necessary, not arbitrary;

in order to express the necessary conditions which the Idea of
Space imposes.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 4.)</p>
<p class="center">XXVII.</p>
<p><i>The Definitions and Axioms of Elementary Geometry do

a curve line which joins two points is less than any
broken line joining the same points and including the
curve line. (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 4.)</p>

<p><i>The perception of a</i> solid object <i>by sight requires that act

<p><i>The</i> Idea of Time <i>is not derived from experience, for

<i>with the portion of time which it occupies.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 8.)</p>
<p class="center">XXXIII.</p>
<p><i>Time is analogous to Space of</i> one dimension: <i>portions

two, or of three, dimensions, and thus nothing which corresponds
to Figure.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 8.)</p>

<p><i>The Repetition of a set of occurrences, as, for example,
strong and weak, or long and short sounds, according

peculiar to Time, as Figure is to Space.</i> (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 8.)</p>

<p><i>The simplest numerical truths are seen by Intuition; when

equal to the sum of all its parts. (<span class="sc">ii.</span> 9.)</p>

<p><i>There is a</i> pure <i>Science of Motion, which does not depend

<p class="center">XLIV.</p>
<p><i>The pure Mathematical Sciences must be successfully cultivated,
in order that the progress of the principal Inductive

the</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page13">13</span> <i>previous

<p><i>The Idea of Cause is not derived from experience; for in

<p class="center">XLVII.</p>
<p><i>The Idea of Cause is expressed for purposes of science by

and opposite to Action. (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 4.)</p>
<p class="center">XLVIII.</p>
<p><i>The Conception of Force involves the Idea of Cause, as
applied to the motion and rest of bodies. The conception of</i>
force <i>is suggested by muscular action exerted: the conception
of</i> matter <i>arises from muscular action resisted. We necessarily
ascribe to all bodies solidity and inertia, since we
conceive Matter as that which cannot be compressed or moved
without resistance.</i> (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 5.)</p>
<p class="center">XLIX.</p>
<p><i>Mechanical Science depends on the Conception of Force;
and is divided into</i> Statics, <i>the doctrine of Force preventing</i>

Dynamics, <i>the doctrine of Force producing
motion.</i> (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 6.)</p>
<p class="center">L.</p>
<p><i>The Science of Statics depends upon the Axiom, that Action and

form</i>:&mdash;When two equal weights are supported on the
middle point between them, the pressure on the fulcrum
is equal to the sum of the weights. (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 6.)</p>
<p class="center">LI.</p>
<p><i>The Science of Hydrostatics depends upon the Fundamental
Principle that</i> fluids press equally in all directions.
<i>This principle necessarily results from the conception of a
Fluid, as a body of which the parts are perfectly moveable
in all directions. For since the Fluid is a body, it can
transmit pressure; and the transmitted pressure is equal to
the original pressure, in virtue of the Axiom that Reaction
is equal to Action. That the Fundamental Principle is not
derived from experience, is plain both from its evidence and
from its history.</i> (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 6.)</p>
<p class="center">LII.</p>
<p><i>The Science of Dynamics depends upon the three Axioms
above stated respecting Cause. The First Axiom,&mdash;that every
change must have a Cause,&mdash;gives rise to the First Law of
Motion,&mdash;that</i> a body not acted upon by a force will move
with a uniform velocity in a straight line. <i>The Second
Axiom,&mdash;that Causes are measured by their Effects,&mdash;gives
rise to the Second Law of Motion,&mdash;that</i> when a force acts
upon a body in motion, the effect of the force is compounded
with the previously existing motion. <i>The Third
Axiom,&mdash;that</i> Reaction is equal and opposite to Action,&mdash;<i>gives
rise to the Third Law of Motion, which is expressed
in the same terms as the Axiom; Action and Reaction
being understood to signify momentum gained and lost.</i>

<p><i>The above Laws of Motion, historically speaking, were
established by means of experiment: but since they have been
discovered and reduced to their simplest form, they have been
considered by many philosophers as self-evident. This result
is principally due to the introduction and establishment of
terms and definitions, which enable us to express the Laws in
a very simple manner.</i> (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 7.)</p>
<p class="center">LIV.</p>
<p><i>In the establishment of the Laws of Motion, it happened,
in several instances, that Principles were assumed as self-evident
which do not now appear evident, but which have
since been demonstrated from the simplest and most evident
principles. Thus it was assumed that</i> a perpetual motion
is impossible;&mdash;<i>that</i> the velocities of bodies acquired by
falling down planes or curves of the same vertical height
are equal;&mdash;<i>that</i> the actual descent of the center of gravity
is equal to its potential ascent. <i>But we are not hence
to suppose that these assumptions were made without ground:
for since they really follow from the laws of motion, they
were probably, in the minds of the discoverers, the results of
undeveloped demonstrations which their sagacity led them to
divine.</i> (<span class="sc">iii.</span> 7.)</p>
<p class="center">LV.</p>
<p><i>It is a</i> Paradox <i>that Experience should lead us to truths

that these laws are interpretations of the Axioms of Causation.

the right interpretation of the terms which they involve, is

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism I.</span></p>
<p><i>THE two processes by which Science is constructed are
the</i> Explication of Conceptions, <i>and the</i> Colligation of
Facts.</p>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">TO</span> the subject of the present and next Book all that
has preceded is subordinate and preparatory. In
former works we have treated of the History of Scientific
Discoveries and of the History of Scientific Ideas. We
have now to attempt to describe the manner in which
discoveries are made, and in which Ideas give rise to
knowledge. It has already been stated that Knowledge
requires us to possess both Facts and Ideas;&mdash;that
every step in our knowledge consists in applying the
Ideas and Conceptions furnished by our minds to the
Facts which observation and experiment offer to us.
When our Conceptions are clear and distinct, when our
Facts are certain and sufficiently numerous, and when
the Conceptions, being suited to the nature of the <span class="pagenum" id="page28">28</span>
Facts, are applied to them so as to produce an exact
and universal accordance, we attain knowledge of a
precise and comprehensive kind, which we may term
<i>Science</i>. And we apply this term to our knowledge
still more decidedly when, Facts being thus included
in exact and general Propositions, such Propositions
are, in the same manner, included with equal rigour
in Propositions of a higher degree of Generality; and
these again in others of a still wider nature, so as to
form a large and systematic whole.</p>
<p>But after thus stating, in a general way, the nature
of science, and the elements of which it consists, we
have been examining with a more close and extensive
scrutiny, some of those elements; and we must now
return to our main subject, and apply to it the results
of our long investigation. We have been exploring
the realm of Ideas; we have been passing in review
the difficulties in which the workings of our own minds
involve us when we would make our conceptions consistent
with themselves: and we have endeavoured to
get a sight of the true solutions of these difficulties.
We have now to inquire how the results of these long
and laborious efforts of thought find their due place in
the formation of our Knowledge. What do we gain
by these attempts to make our notions distinct and
consistent; and in what manner is the gain of which
we thus become possessed, carried to the general treasure-house
of our permanent and indestructible knowledge? After all this
battling in the world of ideas,
all this struggling with the shadowy and changing
forms of intellectual perplexity, how do we secure to
ourselves the fruits of our warfare, and assure ourselves
that we have really pushed forwards the frontier of
the empire of Science? It is by such an appropriation,
that the task which we have had in our hands
during the two previous works, (the <i>History of the
Inductive Sciences</i> and the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>,)
must acquire its real value and true place in our design.</p>
<p class="end">In order to do this, we must reconsider, in a more
definite and precise shape, the doctrine which has
already been laid down;&mdash;that our Knowledge consists <span class="pagenum" id="page29">29</span>
in applying Ideas to Facts; and that the conditions of
real knowledge are that the ideas be distinct and appropriate,
and exactly applied to clear and certain
facts. The steps by which our knowledge is advanced
are those by which one or the other of these two processes
is rendered more complete;&mdash;by which <em>Conceptions</em> are <em>made more
clear</em> in themselves, or by which
the Conceptions more strictly <em>bind together the Facts</em>.
These two processes may be considered as together constituting
the whole formation of our knowledge; and
the principles which have been established in the History of
Scientific Ideas bear principally upon the former
of these two operations;&mdash;upon the business of elevating
our conceptions to the highest possible point of precision
and generality. But these two portions of the
progress of knowledge are so clearly connected with
each other, that we shall deal with them in immediate
succession. And having now to consider these operations
in a more exact and formal manner than it was
before possible to do, we shall designate them by certain
constant and technical phrases. We shall speak
of the two processes by which we arrive at science, as
<i>the Explication of Conceptions</i> and <i>the Colligation of
Facts</i>: we shall show how the discussions in which we
have been engaged have been necessary in order to
promote the former of these offices; and we shall
endeavour to point out modes, maxims, and principles
by which the second of the two tasks may also be furthered.</p>

<span class="sc">Of the Explication of Conceptions.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> II.</p>
<p><i>The Explication of Conceptions, as requisite for the progress
of science, has been effected by means of discussions and
controversies among scientists; often by debates concerning
definitions; these controversies have frequently led to the
establishment of a Definition; but along with the Definition,
a corresponding Proposition has always been expressed or
implied. The essential requisite for the advance of science
is the clearness of the Conception, not the establishment of a
Definition. The construction of an exact Definition is often
very difficult. The requisite conditions of clear Conceptions
may often be expressed by Axioms as well as by Definitions.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> III.</p>
<p class="end"><i>Conceptions, for purposes of science, must be</i> appropriate
<i>as well as clear: that is, they must be modifications of</i> that
<i>Fundamental Idea, by which the phenomena can really be interpreted.
This maxim may warn us from errour, though
it may not lead to discovery. Discovery depends upon the
previous cultivation or natural clearness of the appropriate
Idea, and therefore</i> no discovery is the work of accident.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Historical Progress of the Explication of Conceptions.</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="b2c2a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E have given the appellation of <i>Ideas</i> to certain
comprehensive forms of thought,&mdash;as
<i>space</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>composition</i>, <i>resemblance</i>,&mdash;which
we apply to the phenomena which we contemplate.
But the special modifications of these ideas which are <span class="pagenum" id="page31">31</span>
exemplified in particular facts, we have termed <i>Conceptions</i>;
as <i>a circle</i>, <i>a square number</i>, <i>an accelerating
force</i>, <i>a neutral combination</i> of elements, a <i>genus</i>.
Such Conceptions involve in themselves certain necessary and
universal relations derived from the Ideas
just enumerated; and these relations are an indispensable
portion of the texture of our knowledge. But to
determine the contents and limits of this portion of
our knowledge, requires an examination of the Ideas
and Conceptions from which it proceeds. The Conceptions must
be, as it were, carefully <em>unfolded</em>, so as
to bring into clear view the elements of truth with
which they are marked from their ideal origin. This
is one of the processes by which our knowledge is extended
and made more exact; and this I shall describe
as the <i>Explication of Conceptions</i>.</p>
<p>In the several Books of the History of Ideas we
have discussed a great many of the Fundamental Ideas
of the most important existing sciences. We have, in
those Books, abundant exemplifications of the process
now under our consideration. We shall here add a
few general remarks, suggested by the survey which
we have thus made.</p>
<p id="b2c2a2">2. Such discussions as those in which we have been
engaged concerning our fundamental Ideas, have been
the course by which, historically speaking, those Conceptions
which the existing sciences involve have been
rendered so clear as to be fit elements of exact knowledge.
Thus, the disputes concerning the various kinds
and measures of <i>Force</i> were an important part of the
progress of the science of Mechanics. The struggles by
which philosophers attained a right general conception
of <i>plane</i>, of <i>circular</i>, of <i>elliptical Polarization</i>, were
some of the most difficult steps in the modern discoveries
of Optics. A Conception of the <i>Atomic Constitution</i>
of bodies, such as shall include what we know,
and assume nothing more, is even now a matter of
conflict among Chemists. The debates by which, in
recent times, the Conceptions of <i>Species</i> and <i>Genera</i>
have been rendered more exact, have improved the
science of Botany: the imperfection of the science of <span class="pagenum" id="page32">32</span>
Mineralogy arises in a great measure from the circumstance,
that in that subject, the Conception of a <i>Species</i>
is not yet fixed. In Physiology, what a vast advance
would that philosopher make, who should establish a
precise, tenable, and consistent Conception of <i>Life</i>!</p>
<p>Thus discussions and speculations concerning the
import of very abstract and general terms and notions,
may be, and in reality have been, far from useless and
barren. Such discussions arose from the desire of men
to impress their opinions on others, but they had the
effect of making the opinions much more clear and distinct.
In trying to make others understand them, they
learnt to understand themselves. Their speculations
were begun in twilight, and ended in the full brilliance
of day. It was not easily and at once, without expenditure
of labour or time, that men arrived at those
notions which now form the elements of our knowledge;
on the contrary, we have, in the history of
science, seen how hard, discoverers, and the forerunners
of discoverers, have had to struggle with the indistinctness
and obscurity of the intellect, before they could
advance to the critical point at which truth became
clearly visible. And so long as, in this advance, some
speculators were more forward than others, there was
a natural and inevitable ground of difference of opinion,
of argumentation, of wrangling. But the tendency of all
such controversy is to diffuse truth and to
dispel errour. Truth is consistent, and can bear the
tug of war; Errour is incoherent, and falls to pieces
in the struggle. True Conceptions can endure the
sun, and become clearer as a fuller light is obtained;
confused and inconsistent notions vanish like visionary
spectres at the break of a brighter day. And thus
all the controversies concerning such Conceptions as
science involves, have ever ended in the establishment
of the side on which the truth was found.</p>
<p id="b2c2a3">3. Indeed, so complete has been the victory of
truth in most of these instances, that at present we
can hardly imagine the struggle to have been necessary.
The very essence of these triumphs is that they
lead us to regard the views we reject as not only false, <span class="pagenum" id="page33">33</span>
but inconceivable. And hence we are led rather to
look back upon the vanquished with contempt than
upon the victors with gratitude. We now despise those
who, in the Copernican controversy, could not conceive
the apparent motion of the sun on the heliocentric
hypothesis;&mdash;or those who, in opposition to Galileo,
thought that a uniform force might be that which
generated a velocity proportional to the space;&mdash;or
those who held there was something absurd in Newton’s
doctrine of the different refrangibility of differently
coloured rays;&mdash;or those who imagined that
when elements combine, their sensible qualities must
be manifest in the compound;&mdash;or those who were
reluctant to give up the distinction of vegetables into
herbs, shrubs, and trees. We cannot help thinking that
men must have been singularly dull of comprehension,
to find a difficulty in admitting what is to us so plain
and simple. We have a latent persuasion that we in
their place should have been wiser and more clear-sighted;&mdash;that
we should have taken the right side,
and given our assent at once to the truth.</p>
<p id="b2c2a4">4. Yet in reality, such a persuasion is a mere delusion.
The persons who, in such instances as the above,
were on the losing side, were very far, in most cases,
from being persons more prejudiced, or stupid, or narrow-minded,
than the greater part of mankind now
are; and the cause for which they fought was far
from being a manifestly bad one, till it had been so
decided by the result of the war. It is the peculiar
character of scientific contests, that what is only an
epigram with regard to other warfare is a truth in
this;&mdash;They who are defeated are really in the wrong.
But they may, nevertheless, be men of great subtilty,
sagacity, and genius; and we nourish a very foolish
self-complacency when we suppose that we are their
superiors. That this is so, is proved by recollecting
that many of those who have made very great discoveries
have laboured under the imperfection of thought
which was the obstacle to the next step in knowledge.
Though Kepler detected with great acuteness the
Numerical Laws of the solar system, he laboured in <span class="pagenum" id="page34">34</span>
vain to conceive the very simplest of the Laws of
Motion by which the paths of the planets are governed.
Though Priestley made some important steps in chemistry,
he could not bring his mind to admit the doctrine
of a general Principle of Oxidation. How many ingenious
men in the last century rejected the Newtonian Attraction
as an impossible chimera! How
many more, equally intelligent, have, in the same manner,
in our own time, rejected, I do not now mean as
false, but as inconceivable, the doctrine of Luminiferous
Undulations! To err in this way is the lot, not
only of men in general, but of men of great endowments,
and very sincere love of truth.</p>
<p id="b2c2a5">5. And those who liberate themselves from such
perplexities, and who thus go on in advance of their
age in such matters, owe their superiority in no small
degree to such discussions and controversies as those
to which we now refer. In such controversies, the
Conceptions in question are turned in all directions,
examined on all sides; the strength and the weakness
of the maxims which men apply to them are fully tested;
the light of the brightest minds is diffused to other
minds. Inconsistency is unfolded into self-contradiction;
axioms are built up into a system of necessary
truths; and ready exemplifications are accumulated of
that which is to be proved or disproved, concerning
the ideas which are the basis of the controversy.</p>
<p class="end">The History of Mechanics from the time of Kepler
to that of Lagrange, is perhaps the best exemplification
of the mode in which the progress of a science
depends upon such disputes and speculations as give
clearness and generality to its elementary conceptions.
This, it is to be recollected, is the kind of progress of
which we are now speaking; and this is the principal
feature in the portion of scientific history which we
have mentioned. For almost all that was to be done
by reference to observation, was executed by Galileo
and his disciples. What remained was the task of
generalization and simplification. And this was promoted
in no small degree by the various controversies
which took place within that period concerning <span class="pagenum" id="page35">35</span> mechanical
conceptions:&mdash;as, for example, the question
concerning the measure of the Force of Percussion;&mdash;the
war of the <i>Vis Viva</i>;&mdash;the controversy of the
Center of Oscillation;&mdash;of the independence of Statics and
Dynamics;&mdash;of the principle of Least Action;&mdash;of the
evidence of the Laws of Motion;&mdash;and of the number
of Laws really distinct. None of these discussions was
without its influence in giving generality and clearness
to the mechanical ideas of mathematicians: and therefore,
though remote from general apprehension, and
dealing with very abstract notions, they were of eminent
use in the perfecting the science of Mechanics.
Similar controversies concerning fundamental notions,
those, for example, which Galileo himself had to maintain,
were no less useful in the formation of the science
of Hydrostatics. And the like struggles and conflicts,
whether they take the form of controversies between
several persons, or only operate in the efforts and
fluctuations of the discoverer’s mind, are always requisite,
before the conceptions acquire that clearness which
makes them flt to appear in the enunciation of scientific
truth. This, then, was one object of the History
of Ideas;&mdash;to bring under the reader’s notice the main
elements of the controversies which have thus had so
important a share in the formation of the existing
body of science, and the decisions on the controverted
points to which the mature examination of the subject
has led; and thus to give an abundant exhibition of
that step which we term the Explication of Conceptions.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Use of Definitions.</i></p>
<p id="b2c2a6">6. The result of such controversies as we have
been speaking of, often appears to be summed up in a
<i>Definition</i>; and the controversy itself has often assumed
the form of a battle of definitions. For example, the
inquiry concerning the Laws of Falling
Bodies led to the question whether the proper Definition
of a <i>uniform force</i> is, that it generates a velocity
proportional to the <i>space</i> from rest, or to the <i>time</i>.
The controversy of the <i>Vis Viva</i> was, what was the <span class="pagenum" id="page36">36</span>
proper Definition of the <i>measure of force</i>. A principal
question in the classification of minerals is, what is
the Definition of a <i>mineral species</i>. Physiologists have
endeavoured to throw light on their subject, by
Defining <i>organization</i>, or some similar term.</p>
<p id="b2c2a7">7. It is very important for us to observe, that
these controversies have never been questions of insulated
and <em>arbitrary</em> Definitions, as men seem often
tempted to suppose them to have been. In all cases
there is a tacit assumption of some Proposition which
is to be expressed by means of the Definition, and
which gives it its importance. The dispute concerning
the Definition thus acquires a real value, and becomes
a question concerning true and false. Thus in the discussion
of the question, What is a Uniform Force? it
was taken for granted that ‘gravity is a uniform
force:’&mdash;in the debate of the <i>Vis Viva</i>, it was assumed
that ‘in the mutual action of bodies the whole effect
of the force is unchanged:’&mdash;in the zoological definition
of Species, (that it consists of individuals which have,
or may have, sprung from the same parents,) it is presumed
that ‘individuals so related resemble each other
more than those which are excluded by such a definition;’ or
perhaps, that ‘species so defined have permanent and definite
differences.’ A definition of Organization, or of any other
term, which was not employed to express some principle,
would be of no value.</p>
<p>The establishment, therefore, of a right Definition
of a Term may be a useful step in the Explication of
our Conceptions; but this will be the case <em>then</em> only
when we have under our consideration some Proposition
in which the Term is employed. For then the
question really is, how the Conception shall be understood
and defined in order that the Proposition may be
true.</p>
<p id="b2c2a8">8. The establishment of a Proposition requires an
attention to observed Facts, and can never be rightly
derived from our Conceptions alone. We must hereafter
consider the necessity which exists that the Facts
should be rightly bound together, as well as that our
Conceptions should be clearly employed, in order to <span class="pagenum" id="page37">37</span>
lead us to real knowledge. But we may observe here
that, in such cases at least as we are now considering,
the two processes are co-ordinate. To unfold our Conceptions
by the means of Definitions, has never been
serviceable to science, except when it has been associated
with an immediate <em>use</em> of the Definitions. The
endeavour to define a uniform Force was combined
with the assertion that ‘gravity is a uniform force:’
the attempt to define Accelerating Force was immediately
followed by the doctrine that ‘accelerating
forces may be compounded:’ the process of defining
Momentum was connected with the principle that
‘momenta gained and lost are equal:’ naturalists would
have given in vain the Definition of Species which we
have quoted, if they had not also given the ‘characters’
of species so separated. Definition and Proposition
are the two handles of the instrument by which we
apprehend truth; the former is of no use without the
latter. Definition may be the best mode of explaining
our Conception, but that which alone makes it worth
while to explain it in any mode, is the opportunity of
using it in the expression of Truth. When a Definition
is propounded to us as a useful step in knowledge,
we are always entitled to ask what Principle it
serves to enunciate. If there be no answer to this inquiry,
we define and give clearness to our conceptions
in vain. While we labour at such a task, we do but
light up a vacant room;&mdash;we sharpen a knife with
which we have nothing to cut;&mdash;we take exact aim,
while we load our artillery with blank cartridge;&mdash;we
apply strict rules of grammar to sentences which
have no meaning.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we have under our consideration
a proposition probably established, every step
which we can make in giving distinctness and exactness
to the Terms which this proposition involves, is
an important step towards scientific truth. In such
cases, any improvement in our Definition is a real
advance in the explication of our Conception. The
clearness of our impressions casts a light upon the
Ideas which we contemplate and convey to others. <span class="pagenum" id="page38">38</span></p>
<p id="b2c2a9">9. But though <i>Definition</i> may be subservient to a
right explication of our conceptions, it is <em>not essential</em>
to that process. It is absolutely necessary to every
advance in our knowledge, that those by whom such
advances are made should possess clearly the conceptions
which they employ: but it is by no means necessary that
they should unfold these conceptions in the
words of a formal Definition. It is easily seen, by
examining the course of Galileo’s discoveries, that he
had a distinct conception of the <i>Moving Force</i> which
urges bodies downwards upon an inclined plane, while
he still hesitated whether to call it <i>Momentum</i>, <i>Energy</i>,
<i>Impetus</i>, or <i>Force</i>, and did not venture to offer
a Definition of the thing which was the subject of his
thoughts. The Conception of <i>Polarization</i> was clear
in the minds of many optical speculators, from the
time of Huyghens and Newton to that of Young and
Fresnel. This Conception we have defined to be
‘Opposite properties depending upon opposite positions;’
but this notion was, by the discoverers, though constantly
assumed and expressed by means of superfluous
hypotheses, never clothed in definite language. And
in the mean time, it was the custom, among subordinate
writers on the same subjects, to say, that the
term <i>Polarization</i> had no definite meaning, and was
merely an expression of our ignorance. The Definition
which was offered by Haüy and others of a <i>Mineralogical
Species</i>;&mdash;‘The same elements combined in the
same proportions, with the same fundamental form;’&mdash;was
false, inasmuch as it was incapable of being rigorously
applied to any one case; but this defect did not
prevent the philosophers who propounded such a Definition
from making many valuable additions to mineralogical
knowledge, in the way of identifying some
species and distinguishing others. The right Conception
which they possessed in their minds prevented
their being misled by their own very erroneous Definition.
The want of any precise Definitions of <i>Strata</i>,
and <i>Formations</i>, and <i>Epochs</i>, among geologists, has
not prevented the discussions which they have carried
on upon such subjects from being highly serviceable <span class="pagenum" id="page39">39</span>
in the promotion of geological knowledge. For however
much the apparent vagueness of these terms
might leave their arguments open to cavil, there was a
general understanding prevalent among the most intelligent
cultivators of the science, as to what was
meant in such expressions; and this common understanding
sufficed to determine what evidence should
be considered conclusive and what inconclusive, in
these inquiries. And thus the distinctness of Conception,
which is a real requisite of scientific progress,
existed in the minds of the inquirers, although Definitions,
which are a partial and accidental evidence
of this distinctness, had not yet been hit upon. The
Idea had been developed in men’s minds, although a
clothing of words had not been contrived for it, nor,
perhaps, the necessity of such a vehicle felt: and thus
that essential condition of the progress of knowledge,
of which we are here speaking, existed; while it was
left to the succeeding speculators to put this unwritten
Rule in the form of a verbal Statute.</p>
<p class="end" id="b2c2a10">10. Men are often prone to consider it as a thoughtless
<em>omission</em> of an essential circumstance, and as a
<em>neglect</em> which involves some blame, when knowledge
thus assumes a form in which Definitions, or rather
Conceptions, are implied but are not expressed. But in
such a judgment, they assume <em>that</em> to be a matter of
choice requiring attention only, which is in fact as
difficult and precarious as any other portion of the task
of discovery. To <em>define</em>, so that our Definition shall
have any scientific value, requires no small portion of
that sagacity by which truth is detected. As we have
already said, Definitions and Propositions are co-ordinate
in their use and in their origin. In many cases,
perhaps in most, the Proposition which contains a
scientific truth, is apprehended with confidence, but
with some vagueness and vacillation, before it is put in
a positive, distinct, and definite form.&mdash;It is thus known
to be true, before it can be enunciated in terms each of
which is rigorously defined. The business of Definition is
part of the business of discovery. When it has
been clearly seen what ought to be our Definition, it <span class="pagenum" id="page40">40</span>
must be pretty well known what truth we have to
state. The Definition, as well as the discovery, supposes
a decided step in our knowledge to have been
made. The writers on Logic in the middle ages, made
Definition the last stage in the progress of knowledge;
and in this arrangement at least, the history of science,
and the philosophy derived from the history, confirm
their speculative views. If the Explication of our
Conceptions ever assume the form of a Definition, this
will come to pass, not as an arbitrary process, or as a
matter of course, but as the mark of one of those happy
efforts of sagacity to which all the successive advances
of our knowledge are owing.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Use of Axioms.</i></p>
<p class="end" id="b2c2a11">11. Our Conceptions, then, even when they become
so clear as the progress of knowledge requires, are not
adequately expressed, or necessarily expressed at all, by
means of Definitions. We may ask, then, whether there
is any <em>other mode</em> of expression in which we may look
for the evidence and exposition of that peculiar exactness
of thought which the formation of Science demands.
And in answer to this inquiry, we may refer to the
discussions respecting many of the Fundamental Ideas
of the sciences contained in our <i>History</i> of such Ideas.
It has there been seen that these Ideas involve many
elementary truths which enter into the texture of our
knowledge, introducing into it connexions and relations
of the most important kind, although these elementary
truths cannot be deduced from any verbal definition of
the idea. It has been seen that these elementary truths
may often be enunciated by means of <em>Axioms</em>, stated in
addition to, or in preference to, Definitions. For example,
the Idea of Cause, which forms the basis of the
science of Mechanics, makes its appearance in our elementary
mechanical reasonings, not as a Definition, but by
means of the Axioms that ‘Causes are measured by
their effects,’ and that ‘Reaction is equal and opposite
to action.’ Such axioms, tacitly assumed or <span class="pagenum" id="page41">41</span> occasionally
stated, as maxims of acknowledged validity,
belong to all the Ideas which form the foundations of
the sciences, and are constantly employed in the reasoning
and speculations of those who think clearly on
such subjects. It may often be a task of some difficulty
to detect and enunciate in words the Principles
which are thus, perhaps silently and unconsciously,
taken for granted by those who have a share in the
establishment of scientific truth: but inasmuch as
these Principles are an essential element in our knowledge,
it is very important to our present purpose
to separate them from the associated materials, and
to trace them to their origin. This accordingly I
attempted to do, with regard to a considerable number
of the most prominent of such Ideas, in the <i>History</i>.
The reader will there find many of these Ideas
resolved into Axioms and Principles by means of
which their effect upon the elementary reasonings of
the various sciences may be expressed. That Work
is intended to form, in some measure, a representation
of the Ideal Side of our physical knowledge;&mdash;a Table
of those contents of our Conceptions which are not
received directly from facts;&mdash;an exhibition of Rules
to which we know that truth must conform.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Clear and appropriate Ideas.</i></p>
<p id="b2c2a12">12. In order, however, that we may see the necessary
cogency of these rules, we must possess, clearly and
steadily, the Ideas from which the rules flow. In order
to perceive the necessary relations of the Circles of the
Sphere, we must possess clearly the Idea of Solid
Space:&mdash;in order that we may see the demonstration of
the composition of forces, we must have the Idea of
Cause moulded into a distinct Conception of Statical
Force. This is that <em>Clearness of Ideas</em> which we
stipulate for in any one’s mind, as the first essential
condition of his making any new step in the discovery of
truth. And we now see what answer we are able to
give, if we are asked for a Criterion of this Clearness of <span class="pagenum" id="page42">42</span>
Idea. The Criterion is, that the person shall <em>see</em> the
necessity of the Axioms belonging to each Idea;&mdash;shall
accept them in such a manner as to perceive the cogency
of the reasonings founded upon them. Thus, a person
has a clear Idea of Space who follows the reasonings of
geometry and fully apprehends their conclusiveness.
The Explication of Conceptions, which we are speaking
of as an essential part of real knowledge, is the process
by which we bring the Clearness of our Ideas to bear
upon the Formation of our knowledge. And this is
done, as we have now seen, not always, nor generally,
nor principally, by laying down a Definition of the
Conception; but by acquiring such a possession of it
in our minds as enables, indeed compels us, to admit,
along with the Conception, all the Axioms and Principles
which it necessarily implies, and by which it
produces its effect upon our reasonings.</p>
<p id="b2c2a13">13. But in order that we may make any real advance
in the discovery of truth, our Ideas must not only be
clear, they must also be <em>appropriate</em>. Each science has
for its basis a different class of Ideas; and the steps
which constitute the progress of one science can never
be made by employing the Ideas of another kind of
science. No genuine advance could ever be obtained
in Mechanics by applying to the subject the Ideas of
Space and Time merely:&mdash;no advance in Chemistry, by
the use of mere Mechanical Conceptions:&mdash;no discovery
in Physiology, by referring facts to mere Chemical and
Mechanical Principles. Mechanics must involve the
Conception of <i>Force</i>;&mdash;Chemistry, the Conception of
<i>Elementary Composition</i>;&mdash;Physiology, the Conception
of <i>Vital Powers</i>. Each science must advance by means
of its appropriate Conceptions. Each has its own field,
which extends as far as its principles can be applied. I
have already noted the separation of several of these
fields by the divisions of the Books of the <i>History</i> of Ideas.
The Mechanical, the Secondary Mechanical, the Chemical, the
Classificatory, the Biological Sciences form so
many great Provinces in the Kingdom of knowledge,
each in a great measure possessing its own peculiar
fundamental principles. Every attempt to build up a <span class="pagenum" id="page43">43</span>
new science by the application of principles which
belong to an old one, will lead to frivolous and barren
speculations.</p>
<p>This truth has been exemplified in all the instances
in which subtle speculative men have failed in their
attempts to frame new sciences, and especially in the
essays of the ancient schools of philosophy in Greece,
as has already been stated in the History of Science.
Aristotle and his followers endeavoured in vain to
account for the mechanical relation of forces in the
lever by applying the <em>inappropriate</em> geometrical conceptions
of the properties of the circle:&mdash;they speculated to no
purpose about the elementary composition
of bodies, because they assumed the <em>inappropriate</em>
conception of <em>likeness</em> between the elements and the
compound, instead of the genuine notion of elements
merely <em>determining</em> the qualities of the compound. And
in like manner, in modern times, we have seen, in the
history of the fundamental ideas of the physiological
sciences, how all the <em>inappropriate</em> mechanical and
chemical and other ideas which were applied in succession
to the subject failed in bringing into view any
genuine physiological truth.</p>
<p id="b2c2a14">14. That the real cause of the failure in the instances
above mentioned lay in the <i>Conceptions</i>, is
plain. It was not ignorance of the facts which in
these cases prevented the discovery of the truth. Aristotle
was as well acquainted with the fact of the proportion
of the weights which balance on a Lever as Archimedes
was, although Archimedes alone gave the true mechanical
reason for the proportion.</p>
<p>With regard to the doctrine of the Four Elements
indeed, the inapplicability of the conception of
composition of qualities, required, perhaps, to be proved by
some reference to facts. But this conception was
devised at first, and accepted by succeeding times, in a
blind and gratuitous manner, which could hardly have
happened if men had been awake to the necessary
condition of our knowledge;&mdash;that the conceptions
which we introduce into our doctrines are not arbitrary
or accidental notions, but certain peculiar modes of <span class="pagenum" id="page44">44</span>
apprehension strictly determined by the subject of our
speculations.</p>
<p id="b2c2a15">15. It may, however, be said that this injunction
that we are to employ <em>appropriate</em> Conceptions only in
the formation of our knowledge, cannot be of practical
use, because we can only determine what Ideas <em>are</em>
appropriate, by finding that they truly combine the
facts. And this is to a certain extent true. Scientific
discovery must ever depend upon some happy thought,
of which we cannot trace the origin;&mdash;some fortunate
cast of intellect, rising above all rules. No maxims
can be given which inevitably lead to discovery. No
precepts will elevate a man of ordinary endowments
to the level of a man of genius: nor will an inquirer
of truly inventive mind need to come to the teacher
of inductive philosophy to learn how to exercise the
faculties which nature has given him. Such persons
as Kepler or Fresnel, or Brewster, will have their
powers of discovering truth little augmented by any
injunctions respecting Distinct and Appropriate Ideas;
and such men may very naturally question the utility
of rules altogether.</p>
<p id="b2c2a16">16. But yet the opinions which such persons may
entertain, will not lead us to doubt concerning the
value of the attempts to analyse and methodize the
process of discovery. Who would attend to Kepler if
he had maintained that the speculations of Francis
Bacon were worthless? Notwithstanding what has
been said, we may venture to assert that the Maxim
which points out the necessity of Ideas appropriate
as well as clear, for the purpose of discovering truth, is
not without its use. It may, at least, have a value as
a caution or prohibition, and may thus turn us away
from labours certain to be fruitless. We have already
seen, in the <i>History</i> of Ideas, that this maxim, if duly
attended to, would have at once condemned, as wrongly
directed, the speculations of physiologists of the
mathematical, mechanical, chemical, and vital-fluid schools;
since the Ideas which the teachers of these schools
introduce, cannot suffice for the purposes of physiology,
which seeks truths respecting the vital powers. Again, <span class="pagenum" id="page45">45</span>
it is clear from similar considerations that no definition
of a mineralogical species by chemical characters alone
can answer the end of science, since we seek to make
mineralogy, not an analytical but a classificatory science<a id="fnanchor1-2" href="#note1-2"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>.
Even before the appropriate conception is matured in
men’s minds so that they see clearly what it is, they
may still have light enough to see what it is not.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-2" href="#fnanchor1-2">1</a></span> This agrees with what M. Necker has well
observed in his <i>Règne Mineral</i>, that those who have treated
mineralogy as a merely chemical science, have substituted the
analysis of substances for the classification of individuals. See
<i>History of Ideas</i>, b. viii. chap. iii.
</div>
<p id="b2c2a17">17. Another result of this view of the necessity
of appropriate Ideas, combined with a survey of the
history of science is, that though for the most part, as
we shall see, the progress of science consists in accumulating
and combining Facts rather than in debating
concerning Definitions; there are still certain periods
when the <em>discussion</em> of Definitions may be the most
useful mode of cultivating some special branch of
science. This discussion is of course always to be conducted
by the light of facts; and, as has already been
said, along with the settlement of every good Definition
will occur the corresponding establishment of
some Proposition. But still at particular periods, the
want of a Definition, or of the clear conceptions which
Definition supposes, may be peculiarly felt. A good
and tenable Definition of <i>Species</i> in Mineralogy would
at present be perhaps the most important step which
the science could make. A just conception of the
nature of <i>Life</i>, (and if expressed by means of a
Definition, so much the better,) can hardly fail to give its
possessor an immense advantage in the speculations
which now come under the considerations of physiologists.
And controversies respecting Definitions, in
these cases, and such as these, may be very far from
idle and unprofitable.</p>
<p class="end">Thus the knowledge that Clear and Appropriate
Ideas are requisite for discovery, although it does not
lead to any very precise precepts, or supersede the
value of natural sagacity and inventiveness, may still <span class="pagenum" id="page46">46</span>
be of use to us in our pursuit after truth. It may
show us what course of research is, in each stage of
science, recommended by the general analogy of the
history of knowledge; and it may both save us from
hopeless and barren paths of speculation, and make us
advance with more courage and confidence, to know
that we are looking for discoveries in the manner in
which they have always hitherto been made.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Accidental Discoveries.</i></p>
<p id="b2c2a18">18. Another consequence follows from the views
presented in this Chapter, and it is the last I shall at
present mention. <em>No scientific discovery</em> can, with any
justice, be considered <em>due to accident</em>. In whatever
manner facts may be presented to the notice of a discoverer,
they can never become the materials of exact
knowledge, except they find his mind already provided
with precise and suitable conceptions by which they may
be analysed and connected. Indeed, as we have already
seen, facts cannot be observed as Facts, except in virtue
of the Conceptions which the
observer<a id="fnanchor2-2" href="#note2-2"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>
himself unconsciously
supplies; and they are not Facts of Observation for any purpose
of Discovery, except these familiar
and unconscious acts of thought be themselves of a
just and precise kind. But supposing the Facts to be
adequately observed, they can never be combined into
any new Truth, except by means of some new Conceptions,
clear and appropriate, such as I have endeavoured
to characterize. When the observer’s mind is prepared with
such instruments, a very few facts, or it
may be a single one, may bring the process of discovery
into action. But in such cases, this previous
condition of the intellect, and not the single fact, is
really the main and peculiar cause of the success. The
fact is merely the occasion by which the engine of
discovery is brought into play sooner or later. It is,
as I have elsewhere said, only the spark which discharges
a gun already loaded and pointed; and there <span class="pagenum" id="page47">47</span>
is little propriety in speaking of such an accident as
the cause why the bullet hits the mark. If it were
true that the fall of an apple was the occasion of Newton’s
pursuing the train of thought which led to the
doctrine of universal gravitation, the habits and
constitution of Newton’s intellect, and not the apple, were
the real source of this great event in the progress of
knowledge. The common love of the marvellous, and
the vulgar desire to bring down the greatest achievements
of genius to our own level, may lead men to
ascribe such results to any casual circumstances which
accompany them; but no one who fairly considers the
real nature of great discoveries, and the intellectual
processes which they involve, can seriously hold the
opinion of their being the effect of accident.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note2-2" href="#fnanchor2-2">2</a></span>
B. i. of this vol. Aphorism <a href="#b1a3">III.</a>
</div>
<p id="b2c2a19">19. Such accidents never happen to common men.
Thousands of men, even of the most inquiring and
speculative men, had seen bodies fall; but who, except
Newton, ever followed the accident to such consequences?
And in fact, how little of his train of
thought was contained in, or even directly suggested
by, the fall of the apple! If the apple fall, said the
discoverer, ‘why should not the moon, the planets, the
satellites, fall?’ But how much previous thought,&mdash;what
a steady conception of the universality of the
laws of motion gathered from other sources,&mdash;were
requisite, that the inquirer should see any connexion
in these cases! Was it by accident that he saw in the
apple an image of the moon, and of every body in the
solar system?</p>
<p id="b2c2a20">20. The same observations may be made with regard to
the other cases which are sometimes adduced
as examples of accidental discovery. It has been said,
‘By the accidental placing of a rhomb of calcareous
spar upon a book or line Bartholinus discovered the
property of the <i>Double Refraction</i> of light.’ But
Bartholinus could have seen no such consequence in the
accident if he had not previously had a clear conception
of <em>single refraction</em>. A lady, in describing an
optical experiment which had been shown her, said of
her teacher, ‘He told me to <em>increase and diminish</em> <span class="pagenum" id="page48">48</span>
<em>the angle of refraction</em>, and at last I found that he only
meant me to move my head up and down.’ At any
rate, till the lady had acquired the notions which the
technical terms convey, she could not have made
Bartholinus’s discovery by means of his accident. ‘By
accidentally combining two rhombs in different positions,’
it is added, ‘Huyghens discovered the <i>Polarization</i> of
Light.’ Supposing that this experiment had
been made without design, what Huyghens really
observed was, that the images appeared and disappeared
alternately as he turned one of the rhombs
round. But was it an easy or an obvious business to
analyze this curious alternation into the circumstances
of the rays of light having <i>sides</i>, as Newton expressed
it, and into the additional hypotheses which are implied
in the term ‘polarization’? Those will be able
to answer this question, who have found how far from
easy it is to understand clearly what is meant by
‘polarization’ in this case, now that the property is
fully established. Huyghens’s success depended on his
clearness of thought, for this enabled him to perform
the intellectual analysis, which never would have occurred
to most men, however often they had ‘accidentally
combined two rhombs in different positions.’ ‘By accidentally
looking through a prism of the same substance, and turning
it round, Malus discovered the
polarization of light by reflection.’ Malus saw that,
in some positions of the prism, the light reflected
from the windows of the Louvre thus seen through
the prism, became dim. A common man would have
supposed this dimness the result of accident; but
Malus’s mind was differently constituted and disciplined.
He considered the position of the window,
and of the prism; repeated the experiment over and
over; and in virtue of the eminently distinct conceptions
of space which he possessed, resolved the phenomena into
its geometrical conditions. A believer in
accident would not have sought them; a person of
less clear ideas would not have found them. A person
must have a strange confidence in the virtue of chance,
and the worthlessness of intellect, who can say that <span class="pagenum" id="page49">49</span>
‘in all these fundamental discoveries appropriate ideas
had no share,’ and that the discoveries ‘might have
been made by the most ordinary observers.’</p>
<p class="end" id="b2c2a21">21. I have now, I trust, shown in various ways,
how the <i>Explication of Conceptions</i>, including in this
term their clear development from Fundamental Ideas
in the discoverer’s mind, as well as their precise expression
in the form of Definitions or Axioms, when
that can be done, is an essential part in the establishment
of all exact and general physical truths. In doing
this, I have endeavoured to explain in what sense the
possession of clear and appropriate ideas is a main
requisite for every step in scientific discovery. That it
is far from being the only step, I shall soon have to
show; and if any obscurity remain on the subject
treated of in the present chapter, it will, I hope, be
removed when we have examined the other elements
which enter into the constitution of our knowledge.</p>

<span class="sc">Of Facts as the Materials of Science.</span></h3>

</div>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> IV.</p>
<p><i>Facts are the materials of science, but all Facts involve
Ideas. Since in observing Facts, we cannot exclude Ideas,
we must, for the purposes of science, take care that the Ideas
are clear and rigorously applied.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> V.</p>
<p><i>The last Aphorism leads to such Rules as the following:&mdash;That
Facts, for the purposes of material science, must involve
Conceptions of the Intellect only, and not Emotions:&mdash;That
Facts must be observed with reference to our most exact conceptions,
Number, Place, Figure, Motion:&mdash;That they must
also be observed with reference to any other exact conceptions
which the phenomena suggest, as Force, in mechanical phenomena,

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> VI.</p>
<p><i>The resolution of complex Facts into precise and measured

<p class="noind" id="b2c3a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E
have now to examine how Science is built
up by the combination of Facts. In doing this,
we suppose that we have already attained a supply of
definite and certain Facts, free from obscurity and doubt.
We must, therefore, first consider under what conditions
Facts can assume this character.</p>
<p>When we inquire what Facts are to be made the
materials of Science, perhaps the answer which we <span class="pagenum" id="page51">51</span>
should most commonly receive would be, that they
must be <em>True Facts</em>, as distinguished from any mere
inferences or opinions of our own. We should probably be told
that we must be careful in such a case to
consider as Facts, only what we really observe;&mdash;that
we must assert only what we see; and believe nothing
except upon the testimony of our senses.</p>
<p>But such maxims are far from being easy to apply,
as a little examination will convince us.</p>
<p id="b2c3a2">2. It has been explained, in preceding works,
that all perception of external objects and occurrences
involves an active as well as a passive process
of the mind;&mdash;includes not only Sensations, but also
Ideas by which Sensations are bound together, and
have a unity given to them. From this it follows, that
there is a difficulty in separating in our perceptions
what we receive from without, and what we ourselves
contribute from within;&mdash;what we perceive, and what
we infer. In many cases, this difficulty is obvious to
all: as, for example, when we witness the performances
of a juggler or a ventriloquist. In these instances, we
imagine ourselves to see and to hear what certainly we
do not see and hear. The performer takes advantage
of the habits by which our minds supply interruptions
and infer connexions; and by giving us fallacious
indications, he leads us to perceive as an actual fact, what
does not happen at all. In these cases, it is evident
that we ourselves assist in making the fact; for we
make one which does not really exist. In other cases,
though the fact which we perceive be true, we can
easily see that a large portion of the perception is our
own act; as when, from the sight of a bird of prey we
infer a carcase, or when we read a half-obliterated inscription.
In the latter case, the mind supplies the
meaning, and perhaps half the letters; yet we do not
hesitate to say that we actually <em>read</em> the inscription.
Thus, in many cases, our own inferences and interpretations
enter into our facts. But this happens in
many instances in which it is at first sight less obvious.
When any one has seen an oak-tree blown down by a
strong gust of wind, he does not think of the occurrence <span class="pagenum" id="page52">52</span>
any otherwise than as a <em>Fact</em> of which he is assured by
his senses. Yet by what sense does he perceive the
Force which he thus supposes the wind to exert? By
what sense does he distinguish an Oak-tree from all
other trees? It is clear upon reflexion, that in such
a case, his own mind supplies the conception of extraneous
impulse and pressure, by which he thus interprets the motions
observed, and the distinction of
different kinds of trees, according to which he thus
names the one under his notice. The Idea of Force,
and the idea of definite Resemblances and Differences,
are thus combined with the impressions on our senses,
and form an undistinguished portion of that which we
consider as the Fact. And it is evident that we can in
no other way perceive Force, than by seeing motion;
and cannot give a Name to any object, without not
only seeing a difference of single objects, but supposing
a difference of classes of objects. When we speak as
if we saw impulse and attraction, things and classes,
we really see only objects of various forms and colours,
more or less numerous, variously combined. But do
we really perceive so much as this? When we see the
form, the size, the number, the motion of objects, are
these really mere impressions on our senses, unmodified
by any contribution or operation of the mind
itself? A very little attention will suffice to convince
us that this is not the case. When we see a windmill
turning, it may happen, as we have elsewhere
noticed<a id="fnanchor3-2" href="#note3-2"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>,
that we mistake the direction in which the sails turn:
when we look at certain diagrams, they may appear
either convex or concave: when we see the moon first
in the horizon and afterwards high up in the sky, we
judge her to be much larger in the former than in the
latter position, although to the eye she subtends the
same angle. And in these cases and the like, it has
been seen that the errour and confusion which we thus
incur arise from the mixture of acts of the mind itself
with impressions on the senses. But such acts are, as
we have also seen, <em>inseparable</em> portions of the process <span class="pagenum" id="page53">53</span>
of perception. A certain activity of the mind is involved,
not only in seeing objects erroneously, but in
seeing them at all. With regard to solid objects, this
is generally acknowledged. When we seem to see an
edifice occupying space in all dimensions, we really see
only a representation of it as it appears referred by
perspective to a surface. The inference of the solid
form is an operation of our own, alike when we look at
a reality and when we look at a picture. But we may
go further. Is plane Figure really a mere Sensation?
If we look at a decagon, do we see at once that it has
ten sides, or is it not necessary for us to count them:
and is not counting an act of the mind? All objects
are seen in space; all objects are seen as one or many:
but are not the Idea of Space and the Idea of Number
requisite in order that we may thus apprehend what
we see? That these Ideas of Space and Number involve a
connexion derived from the mind, and not from
the senses, appears, as we have already seen, from this,
that those Ideas afford us the materials of universal
and necessary truths:&mdash;such truths as the senses cannot
possibly supply. And thus, even the perception of
such facts as the size, shape, and number of objects,
cannot be said to be impressions of sense, distinct from
all acts of mind, and cannot be expected to be free
from errour on the ground of their being mere observed
Facts.</p>

</div>
<p>Thus the difficulty which we have been illustrating,
of distinguishing Facts from inferences and from
interpretations of facts, is not only great, but amounts to an
impossibility. The separation at which we aimed in
the outset of this discussion, and which was supposed
to be necessary in order to obtain a firm groundwork
for science, is found to be unattainable. We cannot
obtain a sure basis of Facts, by rejecting all inferences
and judgments of our own, for such inferences and
judgments form an unavoidable element in all Facts.
We cannot exclude our Ideas from our Perceptions,
for our Perceptions involve our Ideas.</p>
<p id="b2c3a3">3. But still, it cannot be doubted that in selecting
the Facts which are to form the foundation of Science, <span class="pagenum" id="page54">54</span>
we must reduce them to their most simple and certain
form; and must reject everything from which doubt or
errour may arise. Now since this, it appears, cannot
be done, by rejecting the Ideas which all Facts involve,
in what manner are we to conform to the obvious maxim,
that the Facts which form the basis of
Science must be perfectly definite and certain?</p>
<p>The analysis of facts into Ideas and Sensations,
which we have so often referred to, suggests the answer
to this inquiry. We are not able, nor need we
endeavour, to exclude Ideas from our Facts; but we
may be able to discern, with perfect distinctness, the
Ideas which we include. We cannot observe any phenomena
without applying to them such Ideas as Space
and Number, Cause and Resemblance, and usually,
several others; but we may avoid applying these Ideas
in a wavering or obscure manner, and confounding
Ideas with one another. We cannot read any of the
inscriptions which nature presents to us, without
interpreting them by means of some language which we
ourselves are accustomed to speak; but we may make
it our business to acquaint ourselves perfectly with the
language which we thus employ, and to interpret it
according to the rigorous rules of grammar and analogy.</p>
<p>This maxim, that when Facts are employed as the
basis of Science, we must distinguish clearly the Ideas
which they involve, and must apply these in a distinct
and rigorous manner, will be found to be a more precise
guide than we might perhaps at first expect. We
may notice one or two Rules which flow from it.</p>
<p id="b2c3a4">4. In the first place. Facts, when used as the materials
of physical Science, must be <em>referred to Conceptions
of the Intellect only</em>, all emotions of fear, admiration,
and the like, being rejected or subdued. Thus,
the observations of phenomena which are related as
portents and prodigies, striking terrour and boding
evil, are of no value for purposes of science. The tales
of armies seen warring in the sky, the sound of arms
heard from the clouds, fiery dragons, chariots, swords
seen in the air, may refer to meteorological phenomena;
but the records of phenomena observed in the <span class="pagenum" id="page55">55</span>
state of mind which these descriptions imply can be
of no scientific value. We cannot make the poets our
observers.</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <span class="i0">Armorum sonitum toto Germania cœlo</span><br />

  </div>
 </div>
</div>
<p class="noind">The mixture of fancy and emotion with the observation
of facts has often disfigured them to an extent which
is too familiar to all to need illustration. We have an
example of this result, in the manner in which Comets
are described in the treatises of the middle ages. In
such works, these bodies are regularly distributed into
several classes, accordingly as they assume the form of
a sword, of a spear, of a cross, and so on. When such
resemblances had become matters of interest, the
impressions of the senses were governed, not by the
rigorous conceptions of form and colour, but by these
assumed images; and under these circumstances, we can
attach little value to the statement of what was seen.</p>
<p>In all such phenomena, the reference of the objects
to the exact Ideas of Space, Number, Position, Motion,
and the like, is the first step of Science: and accordingly,
this reference was established at an early period
in those sciences which made an early progress, as, for
instance, Astronomy. Yet even in astronomy there
appears to have been a period when the predominant
conceptions of men in regarding the heavens and the
stars pointed to mythical story and supernatural influence,
rather than to mere relations of space, time,
and motion: and of this primeval condition of those
who gazed at the stars, we seem to have remnants in
the Constellations, in the mythological Names of the
Planets, and in the early prevalence of Astrology. It
was only at a later period, when men had begun to
measure the places, or at least to count the revolutions
of the stars, that Astronomy had its birth.</p>
<p id="b2c3a5">5. And thus we are led to another Rule:&mdash;that in
collecting Facts which are to be made the basis of <span class="pagenum" id="page56">56</span>
Science, the Facts are to be observed, as far as possible,
<i>with reference to place</i>, <i>figure</i>,
<i>number</i>, <i>motion</i>, and the
like Conceptions; which, depending upon the Ideas of
Space and Time, are the most universal, exact, and
simple of our conceptions. It was by early attention to
these relations in the case of the heavenly bodies, that
the ancients formed the science of Astronomy: it was
by not making precise observations of this kind in the
case of terrestrial bodies, that they failed in framing a
science of the Mechanics of Motion. They succeeded
in Optics as far as they made observations of this nature;
but when they ceased to trace the geometrical
paths of rays in the actual experiment, they ceased to
go forwards in the knowledge of this subject.</p>
<p id="b2c3a6">6. But we may state a further Rule:&mdash;that though
these relations of Time and Space are highly important
in almost all Facts, we are not to confine ourselves to
these: but are to consider the phenomena <em>with reference
to other Conceptions also</em>: it being always understood
that these conceptions are to be made as exact and
rigorous as those of geometry and number. Thus the
science of Harmonics arose from considering sounds
with reference to <em>Concords</em> and <em>Discords</em>; the science
of Mechanics arose from not only observing motions as
they take place in Time and Space, but further, referring
them to <em>Force</em> as their <em>Cause</em>. And in like manner, other
sciences depend upon other Ideas, which, as
I have endeavoured to show, are not less fundamental
than those of Time and Space; and like them, capable
of leading to rigorous consequences.</p>
<p id="b2c3a7">7. Thus the Facts which we assume as the basis of
Science are to be freed from all the mists which
imagination and passion throw round them; and to be
separated into those elementary Facts which exhibit
simple and evident relations of Time, or Space, or
Cause, or some other Ideas equally clear. We resolve
the complex appearances which nature offers to us,
and the mixed and manifold modes of looking at these
appearances which rise in our thoughts, into limited,
definite, and clearly-understood portions. This process
we may term the <i>Decomposition of Facts</i>. It is the <span class="pagenum" id="page57">57</span>
beginning of exact knowledge,&mdash;the first step in the
formation of all Science. This Decomposition of Facts
into Elementary Facts, clearly understood and surely
ascertained, must precede all discovery of the laws of
nature.</p>
<p id="b2c3a8">8. But though this step is necessary, it is not infallibly
sufficient. It by no means follows that when we
have thus decomposed Facts into Elementary Truths
of observation, we shall soon be able to combine these,
so as to obtain Truths of a higher and more speculative
kind. We have examples which show us how
far this is from being a necessary consequence of the
former step. Observations of the weather, made and
recorded for many years, have not led to any general
truths, forming a science of Meteorology: and although
great numerical precision has been given to such
observations by means of barometers, thermometers, and
other instruments, still, no general laws regulating the
cycles of change of such phenomena have yet been
discovered. In like manner the faces of crystals, and
the sides of the polygons which these crystals form,
were counted, and thus numerical facts were obtained,
perfectly true and definite, but still of no value for
purposes of science. And when it was discovered
what Element of the form of crystals it was important
to observe and measure, namely, the Angle made by
two faces with each other, this discovery was a step of
a higher order, and did not belong to that department,
of mere exact observation of manifest Facts,
with which we are here concerned.</p>
<p id="b2c3a9">9. When the Complex Facts which nature offers to
us are thus decomposed into Simple Facts, the
decomposition, in general, leads to the introduction of <em>Terms</em>
and Phrases, more or less technical, by which these
Simple Facts are described. When Astronomy was
thus made a science of measurement, the things measured
were soon described as <i>Hours</i>, and <i>Days</i>, and
<i>Cycles</i>, <i>Altitude</i> and <i>Declination</i>,
<i>Phases</i> and <i>Aspects</i>.
In the same manner, in Music, the concords had names
assigned them, as <i>Diapente</i>, <i>Diatessaron</i>, <i>Diapason</i>; in
studying Optics, the <i>Rays</i> of light were spoken of as <span class="pagenum" id="page58">58</span>
having their course altered by <i>Reflexion</i> and <i>Refraction</i>;
and when useful observations began to be made
in Mechanics, the observers spoke of <i>Force</i>, <i>Pressure</i>,
<i>Momentum</i>, <i>Inertia</i>, and the like.</p>
<p id="b2c3a10">10. When we take phenomena in which the leading Idea is
Resemblance, and resolve them into precise
component Facts, we obtain some kind of Classification;
as, for instance, when we lay down certain Rules
by which particular trees, or particular animals are to
be known. This is the earliest form of Natural History;
and the Classification which it involves is that
which corresponds, nearly or exactly, with the usual
Names of the objects thus classified.</p>
<p class="end" id="b2c3a11">11. Thus the first attempts to render observation
certain and exact, lead to a decomposition of the obvious
facts into Elementary Facts, connected by the
Ideas of Space, Time, Number, Cause, Likeness, and
others: and into a Classification of the Simple Facts;
a classification more or less just, and marked by Names
either common or technical. Elementary Facts, and
Individual Objects, thus observed and classified, form
the materials of Science; and any improvement in
Classification or Nomenclature, or any discovery of a
Connexion among the materials thus accumulated,
leads us fairly within the precincts of Science. We
must now, therefore, consider the manner in which
Science is built up of such materials;&mdash;the process by
which they are brought into their places, and the
texture of the bond which unites and cements them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> IX.</p>
<p><i>The truth of tentative hypotheses must be tested by their

<p class="noind" id="b2c4a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> F</span>ACTS
such as the last Chapter speaks of are, by
means of such Conceptions as are described in
the preceding Chapter, bound together so as to give
rise to those general Propositions of which Science
consists. Thus the Facts that the planets revolve <span class="pagenum" id="page60">60</span>
about the sun in certain periodic times and at certain
distances, are included and connected in Kepler’s Law,
by means of such Conceptions as the <i>squares of numbers</i>,
the <i>cubes of distances</i>, and the <i>proportionality</i> of
these quantities. Again the existence of this proportion
in the motions of any two planets, forms a set of
Facts which may all be combined by means of the
Conception of a certain <i>central accelerating force</i>, as
was proved by Newton. The whole of our physical
knowledge consists in the establishment of such
propositions; and in all such cases, Facts are bound
together by the aid of suitable Conceptions. This part
of the formation of our knowledge I have called the
<i>Colligation of Facts</i>: and we may apply this term to
every case in which, by an act of the intellect, we
establish a precise connexion among the phenomena
which are presented to our senses. The knowledge of
such connexions, accumulated and systematized, is
Science. On the steps by which science is thus collected
from phenomena we shall proceed now to make
a few remarks.</p>
<p id="b2c4a2">2. Science begins with <em>Common</em> Observation of
facts, in which we are not conscious of any peculiar
discipline or habit of thought exercised in observing.
Thus the common perceptions of the appearances and
recurrences of the celestial luminaries, were the first
steps of Astronomy: the obvious cases in which bodies
fall or are supported, were the beginning of Mechanics;
the familiar aspects of visible things, were the origin
of Optics; the usual distinctions of well-known plants,
first gave rise to Botany. Facts belonging to such
parts of our knowledge are noticed by us, and accumulated
in our memories, in the common course of our
habits, almost without our being aware that we are
observing and collecting facts. Yet such facts may
lead to many scientific truths; for instance, in the first
stages of Astronomy (as we have shown in the <i>History</i>)
such facts led to Methods of Intercalation and Rules
of the Recurrence of Eclipses. In succeeding stages
of science, more especial attention and preparation on
the part of the observer, and a selection of certain <span class="pagenum" id="page61">61</span>
<em>kinds</em> of facts, becomes necessary; but there is an early
period in the progress of knowledge at which man is
a physical philosopher, without seeking to be so, or
being aware that he is so.</p>
<p id="b2c4a3">3. But in all stages of the progress, even in that
early one of which we have just spoken, it is necessary,
in order that the facts may be fit materials of
any knowledge, that they should be decomposed into
Elementary Facts, and that these should be observed
with precision. Thus, in the first infancy of astronomy,
the recurrence of phases of the moon, of places
of the sun’s rising and setting, of planets, of eclipses,
was observed to take place at intervals of certain definite
numbers of days, and in a certain exact order;
and thus it was, that the observations became portions
of astronomical science. In other cases, although the
facts were equally numerous, and their general aspect
equally familiar, they led to no science, because their
exact circumstances were not apprehended. A vague
and loose mode of looking at facts very easily observable,
left men for a long time under the belief that a
body, ten times as heavy as another, falls ten times as
fast;&mdash;that objects immersed in water are always magnified,
without regard to the form of the surface;&mdash;that
the magnet exerts an irresistible force;&mdash;that
crystal is always found associated with ice;&mdash;and the
like. These and many others are examples how blind
and careless men can be, even in observation of the
plainest and commonest appearances; and they show
us that the mere faculties of perception, although
constantly exercised upon innumerable objects, may long
fail in leading to any exact knowledge.</p>
<p id="b2c4a4">4. If we further inquire what was the favourable
condition through which some special classes of facts
were, from the first, fitted to become portions of science,
we shall find it to have been principally this;&mdash;that
these facts were considered with reference to the
Ideas of Time, Number, and Space, which are Ideas
possessing peculiar definiteness and precision; so that
with regard to them, confusion and indistinctness are
hardly possible. The interval from new moon to new <span class="pagenum" id="page62">62</span>
moon was always a particular number of days: the
sun in his yearly course rose and set near to a known
succession of distant objects: the moon’s path passed
among the stars in a certain order:&mdash;these are observations
in which mistake and obscurity are not likely
to occur, if the smallest degree of attention is bestowed
upon the task. To count a number is, from the first
opening of man’s mental faculties, an operation which
no science can render more precise. The relations of
space are nearest to those of number in obvious and
universal evidence. Sciences depending upon these
Ideas arise with the first dawn of intellectual civilization.
But few of the other Ideas which man employs
in the acquisition of knowledge possess this clearness
in their common use. The Idea of <i>Resemblance</i> may
be noticed, as coming next to those of Space and Number
in original precision; and the Idea of <i>Cause</i>, in a
certain vague and general mode of application, sufficient
for the purposes of common life, but not for the
ends of science, exercises a very extensive influence
over men’s thoughts. But the other Ideas on which
science depends, with the Conceptions which arise out
of them, are not unfolded till a much later period of
intellectual progress; and therefore, except in such
limited cases as I have noticed, the observations of
common spectators and uncultivated nations, however
numerous or varied, are of little or no effect in giving
rise to Science.</p>
<p id="b2c4a5">5. Let us now suppose that, besides common everyday
perception of facts, we turn our attention to some
other occurrences and appearances, with a design of
obtaining from them speculative knowledge. This
process is more peculiarly called <i>Observation</i>, or, when
we ourselves occasion the facts, <i>Experiment</i>. But the
same remark which we have already made, still holds
good here. These facts can be of no value, except
they are resolved into those exact Conceptions which
contain the essential circumstances of the case. They
must be determined, not indeed necessarily, as has
sometimes been said, ‘according to Number, Weight,
and Measure;’ for, as we have endeavoured to show <span class="pagenum" id="page63">63</span>
in the preceding Books<a id="fnanchor4-2" href="#note4-2"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>,
there are many other
Conceptions to which phenomena may be subordinated,
quite different from these, and yet not at all less
definite and precise. But in order that the facts obtained
by observation and experiment may be capable of
being used in furtherance of our exact and solid knowledge,
they must be apprehended and analysed according to some
Conceptions which, applied for this purpose, give distinct
and definite results, such as can be
steadily taken hold of and reasoned from; that is, the
facts must be referred to Clear and Appropriate Ideas,
according to the manner in which we have already explained
this condition of the derivation of our knowledge. The
phenomena of light, when they are such
as to indicate sides in the ray, must be referred to the
Conception of <i>polarization</i>; the phenomena of mixture,
when there is an alteration of qualities as well
as quantities, must be combined by a Conception of
<i>elementary composition</i>. And thus, when mere position,
and number, and resemblance, will no longer answer the
purpose of enabling us to connect the facts,
we call in other Ideas, in such cases more efficacious,
though less obvious.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-2" href="#fnanchor4-2">4</a></span>
<i>Hist. of Sci. Id.</i> Bs. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. x.
</div>
<p id="b2c4a6">6. But how are we, in these cases, to discover such
Ideas, and to judge which will be efficacious, in leading
to a scientific combination of our experimental data?
To this question, we must in the first place answer,
that the first and great instrument by which facts, so
observed with a view to the formation of exact knowledge,
are combined into important and permanent
truths, is that peculiar Sagacity which belongs to the
genius of a Discoverer; and which, while it supplies
those distinct and appropriate Conceptions which lead
to its success, cannot be limited by rules, or expressed
in definitions. It would be difficult or impossible to
describe in words the habits of thought which led Archimedes
to refer the conditions of equilibrium on the
Lever to the Conception of <i>pressure</i>, while Aristotle
could not see in them anything more than the results <span class="pagenum" id="page64">64</span>
of the strangeness of the properties of the circle;&mdash;or
which impelled Pascal to explain by means of the
Conception of the <i>weight of air</i>, the facts which his
predecessors had connected by the notion of nature’s
horrour of a vacuum;&mdash;or which caused Vitello and
Roger Bacon to refer the magnifying power of a convex lens
to the bending of the rays of light towards
the perpendicular by <i>refraction</i>, while others conceived
the effect to result from the matter of medium, with
no consideration of its form. These are what are commonly
spoken of as felicitous and inexplicable strokes
of inventive talent; and such, no doubt, they are. No
rules can ensure to us similar success in new cases; or
can enable men who do not possess similar endowments,
to make like advances in knowledge.</p>
<p id="b2c4a7">7. Yet still, we may do something in tracing the
process by which such discoveries are made; and this
it is here our business to do. We may observe that
these, and the like discoveries, are not improperly
described as happy <i>Guesses</i>; and that Guesses, in these
as in other instances, imply various suppositions made,
of which some one turns out to be the right one. We
may, in such cases, conceive the discoverer as inventing
and trying many conjectures, till he finds one
which answers the purpose of combining the scattered
facts into a single rule. The discovery of general
truths from special facts is performed, commonly at
least, and more commonly than at first appears, by
the use of a series of Suppositions, or <i>Hypotheses</i>,
which are looked at in quick succession, and of which
the one which really leads to truth is rapidly detected,
and when caught sight of, firmly held, verified, and
followed to its consequences. In the minds of most
discoverers, this process of invention, trial, and
acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis, goes on so rapidly
that we cannot trace it in its successive steps. But in
some instances, we can do so; and we can also see that
the other examples of discovery do not differ essentially
from these. The same intellectual operations
take place in other cases, although this often happens
so instantaneously that we lose the trace of the <span class="pagenum" id="page65">65</span>
progression. In the discoveries made by Kepler, we have
a curious and memorable exhibition of this process in
its details. Thanks to his communicative disposition,
we know that he made nineteen hypotheses with regard
to the motion of Mars, and calculated the results
of each, before he established the true doctrine, that
the planet’s path is an ellipse. We know, in like manner,
that Galileo made wrong suppositions respecting
the laws of falling bodies, and Mariotte, concerning
the motion of water in a siphon, before they hit upon
the correct view of these cases.</p>
<p id="b2c4a8">8. But it has very often happened in the history of
science, that the erroneous hypotheses which preceded
the discovery of the truth have been made, not by the
discoverer himself, but by his precursors; to whom he
thus owed the service, often an important one in such
cases, of exhausting the most tempting forms of errour.
Thus the various fruitless suppositions by which Kepler
endeavoured to discover the law of reflection, led
the way to its real detection by Snell; Kepler’s numerous
imaginations concerning the forces by which the
celestial motions are produced,&mdash;his ‘physical reasonings’
as he termed them,&mdash;were a natural prelude to
the truer physical reasonings of Newton. The various
hypotheses by which the suspension of vapour in air
had been explained, and their failure, left the field
open for Dalton with his doctrine of the mechanical
mixture of gases. In most cases, if we could truly
analyze the operation of the thoughts of those who
make, or who endeavour to make discoveries in science,
we should find that many more suppositions pass
through their minds than those which are expressed
in words; many a possible combination of conceptions
is formed and soon rejected. There is a constant
invention and activity, a perpetual creating and selecting
power at work, of which the last results only are
exhibited to us. Trains of hypotheses are called up and
pass rapidly in review; and the judgment makes its
choice from the varied group.</p>
<p id="b2c4a9">9. It would, however, be a great mistake to suppose
that the hypotheses, among which our choice thus <span class="pagenum" id="page66">66</span>
lies, are constructed by an enumeration of obvious
cases, or by a wanton alteration of relations which
occur in some first hypothesis. It may, indeed, sometimes
happen that the proposition which is finally
established is such as may be formed, by some slight
alteration, from those which are justly rejected. Thus
Kepler’s elliptical theory of Mars’s motions, involved
relations of lines and angles much of the same nature
as his previous false suppositions: and the true law of
refraction so much resembles those erroneous ones
which Kepler tried, that we cannot help wondering
how he chanced to miss it. But it more frequently
happens that new truths are brought into view by the
application of new Ideas, not by new modifications of
old ones. The cause of the properties of the Lever
was learnt, not by introducing any new <em>geometrical</em>
combination of lines and circles, but by referring the
properties to genuine <em>mechanical</em> Conceptions. When
the Motions of the Planets were to be explained, this
was done, not by merely improving the previous notions,
of cycles of time, but by introducing the new
conception of <em>epicycles</em> in space. The doctrine of the
Four Simple Elements was expelled, not by forming
any new scheme of elements which should impart,
according to new rules, their sensible qualities to their
compounds, but by considering the elements of bodies
as <em>neutralizing</em> each other. The Fringes of Shadows
could not be explained by ascribing new properties to
the single rays of light, but were reduced to law by
referring them to the <em>interference</em> of several rays.</p>
<p>Since the true supposition is thus very frequently
something altogether diverse from all the obvious
conjectures and combinations, we see here how far we are
from being able to reduce discovery to rule, or to give
any precepts by which the want of real invention and
sagacity shall be supplied. We may warn and encourage
these faculties when they exist, but we cannot
create them, or make great discoveries when they are
absent.</p>
<p id="b2c4a10">10. The Conceptions which a true theory requires
are very often clothed in a <i>Hypothesis</i> which connects <span class="pagenum" id="page67">67</span>
with them several superfluous and irrelevant circumstances.
Thus the Conception of the Polarization of
Light was originally represented under the image of
particles of light having their poles all turned in the
same direction. The Laws of Heat may be made out
perhaps most conveniently by conceiving Heat to be
a <i>Fluid</i>. The Attraction of Gravitation might have
been successfully applied to the explanation of facts, if
Newton had throughout treated Attraction as the result of
an <i>Ether</i> diffused through space; a supposition
which he has noticed as a possibility. The doctrine of
Definite and Multiple Proportions may be conveniently
expressed by the hypothesis of <i>Atoms</i>. In such cases,
the Hypothesis may serve at first to facilitate the
introduction of a new Conception. Thus a pervading
Ether might for a time remove a difficulty, which some
persons find considerable, of imagining a body to exert
force at a distance. A Particle with Poles is more
easily conceived than Polarization in the abstract.
And if hypotheses thus employed will really explain
the facts by means of a few simple assumptions, the
laws so obtained may afterwards be reduced to a simpler
form than that in which they were first suggested.
The general laws of Heat, of Attraction, of Polarization,
of Multiple Proportions, are now certain, whatever image
we may form to ourselves of their ultimate causes.</p>
<p id="b2c4a11">11. In order, then, to discover scientific truths,
suppositions consisting either of new Conceptions, or of
new Combinations of old ones, are to be made, till we
find one supposition which succeeds in binding together
the Facts. But how are we to find this? How is the
trial to be made? What is meant by ‘success’ in these
cases? To this we reply, that our inquiry must be,
whether the Facts have the same relation in the Hypothesis
which they have in reality;&mdash;whether the results
of our suppositions agree with the phenomena which
nature presents to us. For this purpose, we must
both carefully observe the phenomena, and steadily
trace the consequences of our assumptions, till we can <span class="pagenum" id="page68">68</span>
bring the two into comparison. The Conceptions which
our hypotheses involve, being derived from certain
Fundamental Ideas, afford a basis of rigorous reasoning,
as we have shown in the Books of the <i>History</i> of those
Ideas. And the results to which this reasoning leads,
will be susceptible of being verified or contradicted by
observation of the facts. Thus the Epicyclical Theory
of the Moon, once assumed, determined what the
moon’s place among the stars ought to be at any given
time, and could therefore be tested by actually observing
the moon’s places. The doctrine that musical
strings of the same length, stretched with weights of
1, 4, 9, 16, would give the musical intervals of an octave,
a fifth, a fourth, in succession, could be put to the
trial by any one whose ear was capable of appreciating
those intervals: and the inference which follows from
this doctrine by numerical reasoning,&mdash;that there must
be certain imperfections in the concords of every musical
scale,&mdash;could in like manner be confirmed by trying
various modes of <i>Temperament</i>. In like manner
all received theories in science, up to the present time,
have been established by taking up some supposition,
and comparing it, directly or by means of its remoter
consequences, with the facts it was intended to embrace.
Its agreement, under certain cautions and conditions,
of which we may hereafter speak, is held to be the
evidence of its truth. It answers its genuine purpose,
the Colligation of Facts.</p>
<p id="b2c4a12">12. When we have, in any subject, succeeded in one
attempt of this kind, and obtained some true Bond of
Unity by which the phenomena are held together, the
subject is open to further prosecution; which ulterior
process may, for the most part, be conducted in a more
formal and technical manner. The first great outline
of the subject is drawn; and the finishing of the
resemblance of nature demands a more minute pencilling,
but perhaps requires less of genius in the master. In
the pursuance of this task, rules and precepts may be
given, and features and leading circumstances pointed
out, of which it may often be useful to the inquirer to
be aware. <span class="pagenum" id="page69">69</span></p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I shall speak of some
characteristic marks which belong to such scientific
processes as are now the subject of our consideration,
and which may sometimes aid us in determining when
the task has been rightly executed.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
two operations spoken of in the preceding
chapters,&mdash;the Explication of the Conceptions
of our own minds, and the Colligation of observed Facts
by the aid of such Conceptions,&mdash;are, as we have just
said, inseparably connected with each other. When
united, and employed in collecting knowledge from the
phenomena which the world presents to us, they constitute
the mental process of <i>Induction</i>; which is usually and
justly spoken of as the genuine source of all
our <em>real general knowledge</em> respecting the external
world. And we see, from the preceding analysis of
this process into its two constituents, from what origin
it derives each of its characters. It is <em>real</em>, because it
arises from the combination of Real Facts, but it is
<em>general</em>, because it implies the possession of General
Ideas. Without the former, it would not be knowledge of the
External World; without the latter, it
would not be Knowledge at all. When Ideas and
Facts are separated from each other, the neglect of
Facts gives rise to empty speculations, idle subtleties,
visionary inventions, false opinions concerning the laws
of phenomena, disregard of the true aspect of nature: <span class="pagenum" id="page72">72</span>
while the want of Ideas leaves the mind overwhelmed,
bewildered, and stupified by particular sensations, with
no means of connecting the past with the future, the
absent with the present, the example with the rule;
open to the impression of all appearances, but capable
of appropriating none. Ideas are the <em>Form</em>, facts the
<em>Material</em>, of our structure. Knowledge does not
consist in the empty mould, or in the brute mass of matter,
but in the rightly-moulded substance. Induction
gathers general truths from particular facts;&mdash;and in
her harvest, the corn and the reaper, the solid ears and
the binding band, are alike requisite. All our knowledge
of nature is obtained by Induction; the term
being understood according to the explanation we have
now given. And our knowledge is then most complete, then
most truly deserves the name of Science,
when both its elements are most perfect;&mdash;when the
Ideas which have been concerned in its formation have,
at every step, been clear and consistent; and when
they have, at every step also, been employed in binding
together real and certain Facts. Of such Induction,
I have already given so many examples and illustrations
in the two preceding chapters, that I need not
now dwell further upon the subject.</p>
<p id="b2c5a2">2. Induction is familiarly spoken of as the process
by which we collect a <i>General Proposition</i> from a number
of <i>Particular Cases</i>: and it appears to be frequently
imagined that the general proposition results
from a mere juxta-position of the cases, or at most, from
merely conjoining and extending them. But if we
consider the process more closely, as exhibited in the
cases lately spoken of, we shall perceive that this is an
inadequate account of the matter. The particular
facts are not merely brought together, but there is a
New Element added to the combination by the very
act of thought by which they are combined. There is
a Conception of the mind introduced in the general
proposition, which did not exist in any of the observed
facts. When the Greeks, after long observing the
motions of the planets, saw that these motions might
be rightly considered as produced by the motion of one <span class="pagenum" id="page73">73</span>
wheel revolving in the inside of another wheel, these
Wheels were Creations of their minds, added to the
Facts which they perceived by sense. And even if the
wheels were no longer supposed to be material, but
were reduced to mere geometrical spheres or circles,
they were not the less products of the mind alone,&mdash;something
additional to the facts observed. The same
is the case in all other discoveries. The facts are
known, but they are insulated and unconnected, till
the discoverer supplies from his own stores a Principle
of Connexion. The pearls are there, but they will not
hang together till some one provides the String. The
distances and periods of the planets were all so many
separate facts; by Kepler’s Third Law they are connected
into a single truth: but the Conceptions which
this law involves were supplied by Kepler’s mind, and
without these, the facts were of no avail. The planets
described ellipses round the sun, in the contemplation
of others as well as of Newton; but Newton conceived
the deflection from the tangent in these elliptical
motions in a new light,&mdash;as the effect of a Central Force
following a certain law; and then it was, that such a
force was discovered truly to exist.</p>
<p>Thus<a id="fnanchor5-2" href="#note5-2"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>
in each inference made by Induction, there is
introduced some General Conception, which is given,
not by the phenomena, but by the mind. The conclusion
is not contained in the premises, but includes
them by the introduction of a New Generality. In
order to obtain our inference, we travel beyond the
cases which we have before us; we consider them as
mere exemplifications of some Ideal Case in which the
relations are complete and intelligible. We take a
Standard, and measure the facts by it; and this
Standard is constructed by us, not offered by Nature.
We assert, for example, that a body left to itself will
move on with unaltered velocity; not because our
senses ever disclosed to us a body doing this, but
because (taking this as our Ideal Case) we find that all <span class="pagenum" id="page74">74</span>
actual cases are intelligible and explicable by means of
the Conception of <i>Forces</i>, causing change and motion,
and exerted by surrounding bodies. In like manner,
we see bodies striking each other, and thus moving and
stopping, accelerating and retarding each other: but
in all this, we do not perceive by our senses that
abstract quantity, <i>Momentum</i>, which is always lost by
one body as it is gained by another. This Momentum
is a creation of the mind, brought in among the facts,
in order to convert their apparent confusion into order,
their seeming chance into certainty, their perplexing
variety into simplicity. This the Conception of <i>Momentum
gained and lost</i> does: and in like manner, in
any other case in which a truth is established by Induction,
some Conception is introduced, some Idea is
applied, as the means of binding together the facts,
and thus producing the truth.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-2" href="#fnanchor5-2">5</a></span>
I repeat here remarks made at the end of the <i>Mechanical Euclid</i>, p. 178.
</div>
<p id="b2c5a3">3. Hence in every inference by Induction, there is
some Conception <em>superinduced</em> upon the Facts: and
we may henceforth conceive this to be the peculiar
import of the term <i>Induction</i>. I am not to be understood
as asserting that the term was originally or
anciently employed with this notion of its meaning;
for the peculiar feature just pointed out in Induction
has generally been overlooked. This appears by the
accounts generally given of Induction. ‘Induction,’
says Aristotle<a id="fnanchor6-2" href="#note6-2"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>,
‘is when by means of one extreme
term<a id="fnanchor7-2" href="#note7-2"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> we
infer the other extreme term to be true of
the middle term.’ Thus, (to take such exemplifications
as belong to our subject,) from knowing that Mercury,
Venus, Mars, describe ellipses about the Sun, we infer
that all Planets describe ellipses about the Sun. In
making this inference syllogistically, we assume that
the evident proposition, ‘Mercury, Venus, Mars, do
what all Planets do,’ may be taken <em>conversely</em>, ‘All <span class="pagenum" id="page75">75</span>
Planets do what Mercury, Venus, Mars, do.’ But we
may remark that, in this passage, Aristotle (as was
natural in his line of discussion) turns his attention
entirely to the <em>evidence</em> of the inference; and overlooks
a step which is of far more importance to our knowledge,
namely, the <em>invention</em> of the second extreme
term. In the above instance, the particular luminaries,
Mercury, Venus, Mars, are one logical <i>Extreme</i>; the
general designation Planets is the <i>Middle Term</i>; but
having these before us, how do we come to think of
<i>description of ellipses</i>, which is the other Extreme
of the syllogism? When we have once invented this
‘second Extreme Term,’ we may, or may not, be satisfied
with the evidence of the syllogism; we may, or
may not, be convinced that, so far as this property
goes, the extremes are co-extensive with the middle
term<a id="fnanchor8-2" href="#note8-2"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>;
but the <em>statement</em> of the syllogism is the
important step in science. We know how long Kepler
laboured, how hard he fought, how many devices he
tried, before he hit upon this <em>Term</em>, the Elliptical
Motion. He rejected, as we know, many other ‘second
extreme Terms,’ for example, various combinations of
epicyclical constructions, because they did not represent
with sufficient accuracy the special facts of observation.
When he had established his premiss, that ‘Mars
does describe an Ellipse about the Sun,’ he does not
hesitate to <em>guess</em> at least that, in this respect, he might
<em>convert</em> the other premiss, and assert that ‘All the
Planets do what Mars does.’ But the main business
was, the inventing and verifying the proposition
respecting the Ellipse. The Invention of the Conception
was the great step in the <em>discovery</em>; the Verification of
the Proposition was the great step in the <em>proof</em> of the
discovery. If Logic consists in pointing out the conditions
of proof, the Logic of Induction must consist in
showing what are the conditions of proof, in such
inferences as this: but this subject must be pursued in the
next chapter; I now speak principally of the act of <span class="pagenum" id="page76">76</span>
<i>Invention</i>, which is requisite in every inductive inference.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-2" href="#fnanchor6-2">6</a></span>
<i>Analyt. Prior.</i> lib. ii. c. xxiii. <span class="greek">Περὶ τῆς ἐπαγωγῆς</span>.
</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note7-2" href="#fnanchor7-2">7</a></span> The syllogism here alluded to would
be this:&mdash;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Mercury, Venus, Mars, describe ellipses about the Sun;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;All Planets do what Mercury, Venus, Mars, do;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Therefore all Planets describe ellipses about the Sun.

</div>
<p id="b2c5a4">4. Although in every inductive inference, an act of
invention is requisite, the act soon slips out of notice.
Although we bind together facts by superinducing
upon them a new Conception, this Conception, once
introduced and applied, is looked upon as inseparably
connected with the facts, and necessarily implied in
them. Having once had the phenomena bound together in
their minds in virtue of the Conception, men
can no longer easily restore them back to the detached
and incoherent condition in which they were before
they were thus combined. The pearls once strung,
they seem to form a chain by their nature. Induction
has given them a unity which it is so far from costing
us an effort to preserve, that it requires an effort to
imagine it dissolved. For instance, we usually represent
to ourselves the Earth as <em>round</em>, the Earth and
the Planets as <em>revolving</em> about the Sun, and as <em>drawn</em>
to the Sun by a Central Force; we can hardly understand
how it could cost the Greeks, and Copernicus,
and Newton, so much pains and trouble to arrive at a
view which to us is so familiar. These are no longer
to us Conceptions caught hold of and kept hold of by
a severe struggle; they are the simplest modes of
conceiving the facts: they are really Facts. We are
willing to <em>own</em> our obligation to those discoverers, but we
hardly <em>feel</em> it: for in what other manner (we ask in
our thoughts) could we represent the facts to ourselves?</p>
<p>Thus we see why it is that this step of which we
now speak, the Invention of a new Conception in
every inductive inference, is so generally overlooked
that it has hardly been noticed by preceding philosophers.
When once performed by the discoverer, it
takes a fixed and permanent place in the understanding
of every one. It is a thought which, once breathed
forth, permeates all men’s minds. All fancy they
nearly or quite knew it before. It oft was thought, or
almost thought, though never till now expressed. Men
accept it and retain it, and know it cannot be taken <span class="pagenum" id="page77">77</span>
from them, and look upon it as their own. They will not
and cannot part with it, even though they may deem
it trivial and obvious. It is a secret, which once
uttered, cannot be recalled, even though it be despised
by those to whom it is imparted. As soon as the leading
term of a new theory has been pronounced and
understood, all the phenomena change their aspect.
There is a standard to which we cannot help referring
them. We cannot fall back into the helpless and
bewildered state in which we gazed at them when we
possessed no principle which gave them unity. Eclipses
arrive in mysterious confusion: the notion of a <i>Cycle</i>
dispels the mystery. The Planets perform a tangled
and mazy dance; but <i>Epicycles</i> reduce the maze to
order. The Epicycles themselves run into confusion;
the conception of an <i>Ellipse</i> makes all clear and simple.
And thus from stage to stage, new elements of intelligible
order are introduced. But this intelligible order
is so completely adopted by the human understanding,
as to seem part of its texture. Men ask Whether
Eclipses follow a Cycle; Whether the Planets describe
Ellipses; and they imagine that so long as they do not
<em>answer</em> such questions rashly, they take nothing for
granted. They do not recollect how much they assume
in <em>asking</em> the question:&mdash;how far the conceptions of
Cycles and of Ellipses are beyond the visible surface of
the celestial phenomena:&mdash;how many ages elapsed,
how much thought, how much observation, were
needed, before men’s thoughts were fashioned into the
words which they now so familiarly use. And thus
they treat the subject, as we have seen Aristotle treating
it; as if it were a question, not of invention, but
of proof; not of substance, but of form: as if the main
thing were not <em>what</em> we assert, but <em>how</em> we assert it.
But for our purpose, it is requisite to bear in mind the
feature which we have thus attempted to mark; and
to recollect that, in every inference by induction, there
is a Conception supplied by the mind and superinduced
upon the Facts.</p>
<p class="end" id="b2c5a5">5. In collecting scientific truths by Induction, we
often find (as has already been observed) a Definition <span class="pagenum" id="page78">78</span>
and a Proposition established at the same time,&mdash;introduced
together, and mutually dependent on each
other. The combination of the two constitutes the
Inductive act; and we may consider the Definition as
representing the superinduced Conception, and the
Proposition as exhibiting the Colligation of Facts.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Use of Hypotheses.</i></p>
<p id="b2c5a6">6. To discover a Conception of the mind which will
justly represent a train of observed facts is, in some
measure, a process of conjecture, as I have stated already;
and as I then observed, the business of conjecture is
commonly conducted by calling up before our
minds several suppositions, and selecting that one which
most agrees with what we know of the observed facts.
Hence he who has to discover the laws of nature may
have to invent many suppositions before he hits upon
the right one; and among the endowments which lead
to his success, we must reckon that fertility of invention
which ministers to him such imaginary schemes,
till at last he finds the one which conforms to the true
order of nature. A facility in devising hypotheses,
therefore, is so far from being a fault in the intellectual
character of a discoverer, that it is, in truth, a
faculty indispensable to his task. It is, for his purposes,
much better that he should be too ready in contriving,
too eager in pursuing systems which promise
to introduce law and order among a mass of unarranged
facts, than that he should be barren of such inventions
and hopeless of such success. Accordingly, as we have
already noticed, great discoverers have often invented
hypotheses which would not answer to all the facts, as
well as those which would; and have fancied themselves
to have discovered laws, which a more careful
examination of the facts overturned.</p>
<p>The tendencies of our speculative
nature<a id="fnanchor9-2" href="#note9-2"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>,
carrying <span class="pagenum" id="page79">79</span>
us onwards in pursuit of symmetry and rule, and thus
producing all true theories, perpetually show their
vigour by overshooting the mark. They obtain something,
by aiming at much more. They detect the order
and connexion which exist, by conceiving imaginary
relations of order and connexion which have no existence.
Real discoveries are thus mixed with baseless
assumptions; profound sagacity is combined with fanciful
conjecture; not rarely, or in peculiar instances,
but commonly, and in most cases; probably in all, if we
could read the thoughts of discoverers as we read the
books of Kepler. To try wrong guesses is, with most
persons, the only way to hit upon right ones. The
character of the true philosopher is, not that he never
conjectures hazardously, but that his conjectures are
clearly conceived, and brought into rigid contact with
facts. He sees and compares distinctly the Ideas and
the Things;&mdash;the relations of his notions to each other
and to phenomena. Under these conditions, it is not
only excusable, but necessary for him, to snatch at
every semblance of general rule,&mdash;to try all promising
forms of simplicity and symmetry.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-2" href="#fnanchor9-2">9</a></span>
I here take the liberty of characterizing inventive
minds in general in the same phraseology which, in the History
of Science, I have employed in reference to particular examples.
These expressions are what I have used in speaking of the
discoveries of Copernicus.&mdash;<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. v. c. ii.
</div>
<p>Hence advances in
knowledge<a id="fnanchor10-2" href="#note10-2"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>
are not commonly
made without the previous exercise of some boldness
and license in guessing. The discovery of new truths
requires, undoubtedly, minds careful and scrupulous in
examining what is suggested; but it requires, no less,
such as are quick and fertile in suggesting. What is
Invention, except the talent of rapidly calling before us
the many possibilities, and selecting the appropriate
one? It is true, that when we have rejected all the
inadmissible suppositions, they are often quickly forgotten;
and few think it necessary to dwell on these
discarded hypotheses, and on the process by which they
were condemned. But all who discover truths, must
have reasoned upon many errours to obtain each truth; <span class="pagenum" id="page80">80</span>
every accepted doctrine must have been one chosen
out of many candidates. If many of the guesses of
philosophers of bygone times now appear fanciful and
absurd, because time and observation have refuted them,
others, which were at the time equally gratuitous, have
been conformed in a manner which makes them appear
marvellously sagacious. To form hypotheses, and then
to employ much labour and skill in refuting them, if
they do not succeed in establishing them, is a part of
the usual process of inventive minds. Such a proceeding
belongs to the <em>rule</em> of the genius of discovery,
rather than (as has often been taught in modern times)
to the <em>exception</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-2" href="#fnanchor10-2">10</a></span>

Kepler’s speculations, and are illustrated by reference to his

<p id="b2c5a7">7. But if it be an advantage for the discoverer of
truth that he be ingenious and fertile in inventing
hypotheses which may connect the phenomena of nature,
it is indispensably requisite that he be diligent
and careful in comparing his hypotheses with the facts,
and ready to abandon his invention as soon as it appears
that it does not agree with the course of actual
occurrences. This constant comparison of his own
conceptions and supposition with observed facts under
all aspects, forms the leading employment of the
discoverer: this candid and simple love of truth, which
makes him willing to suppress the most favourite
production of his own ingenuity as soon as it appears to
be at variance with realities, constitutes the first
characteristic of his temper. He must have neither the
blindness which cannot, nor the obstinacy which will
not, perceive the discrepancy of his fancies and his
facts. He must allow no indolence, or partial views,
or self-complacency, or delight in seeming demonstration,
to make him tenacious of the schemes which he
devises, any further than they are confirmed by their
accordance with nature. The framing of hypotheses
is, for the inquirer after truth, not the end, but the
beginning of his work. Each of his systems is invented,
not that he may admire it and follow it into
all its consistent consequences, but that he may make
it the occasion of a course of active experiment and
observation. And if the results of this process
<span class="pagenum" id="page81">81</span> contradict
his fundamental assumptions, however ingenious,
however symmetrical, however elegant his system may
be, he rejects it without hesitation. He allows no
natural yearning for the offspring of his own mind to
draw him aside from the higher duty of loyalty to his
sovereign, Truth: to her he not only gives his
affections and his wishes, but strenuous labour and
scrupulous minuteness of attention.</p>
<p>We may refer to what we have said of Kepler, Newton,
and other eminent philosophers, for illustrations
of this character. In Kepler we have
remarked<a id="fnanchor11-2" href="#note11-2"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> the
courage and perseverance with which he undertook and
executed the task of computing his own hypotheses:
and, as a still more admirable characteristic, that he
never allowed the labour he had spent upon any conjecture
to produce any reluctance in abandoning the
hypothesis, as soon as he had evidence of its inaccuracy.
And in the history of Newton’s discovery
that the moon is retained in her orbit by the force of
gravity, we have noticed the same moderation in maintaining
the hypothesis, after it had once occurred to
the author’s mind. The hypothesis required that the
moon should fall from the tangent of her orbit every
second through a space of sixteen feet; but according
to his first calculations it appeared that in fact she only
fell through a space of thirteen feet in that time. The
difference seems small, the approximation encouraging,
the theory plausible; a man in love with his own fancies
would readily have discovered or invented some
probable cause of the difference. But Newton acquiesced
in it as a disproof of his conjecture, and ‘laid
aside at that time any further thoughts of this
matter<a id="fnanchor12-2" href="#note12-2"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>.’</p>

<p id="b2c5a8">8. It has often happened that those who have undertaken
to instruct mankind have not possessed this pure
love of truth and comparative indifference to the
maintenance of their own inventions. Men have frequently
adhered with great tenacity and vehemence to the hypotheses
which they have once framed; and in their <span class="pagenum" id="page82">82</span>
affection for these, have been prone to overlook, to
distort, and to misinterpret facts. In this manner, <i>Hypotheses</i>
have so often been prejudicial to the genuine
pursuit of truth, that they have fallen into a kind of
obloquy; and have been considered as dangerous temptations
and fallacious guides. Many warnings have
been uttered against the fabrication of hypotheses, by
those who profess to teach philosophy; many disclaimers
of such a course by those who cultivate science.</p>
<p>Thus we shall find Bacon frequently discommending
this habit, under the name of ‘anticipation of the mind,’
and Newton thinks it necessary to say emphatically
‘hypotheses non fingo.’ It has been constantly urged
that the inductions by which sciences are formed must
be <em>cautious</em> and <em>rigorous</em>; and the various imaginations
which passed through Kepler’s brain, and to which he
has given utterance, have been blamed or pitied, as
lamentable instances of an unphilosophical frame of
mind. Yet it has appeared in the preceding remarks
that hypotheses rightly used are among the helps, far
more than the dangers, of science;&mdash;that scientific
induction is not a ‘cautious’ or a ‘rigorous’ process in
the sense of <em>abstaining from</em> such suppositions, but in
<em>not adhering</em> to them till they are confirmed by fact, and
in carefully seeking from facts confirmation or refutation.
Kepler’s distinctive character was, not that he was
peculiarly given to the construction of hypotheses, but
that he narrated with extraordinary copiousness and
candour the course of his thoughts, his labours, and
his feelings. In the minds of most persons, as we have
said, the inadmissible suppositions, when rejected, are
soon forgotten: and thus the trace of them vanishes
from the thoughts, and the successful hypothesis alone
holds its place in our memory. But in reality, many
other transient suppositions must have been made by
all discoverers;&mdash;hypotheses which are not afterwards
asserted as true systems, but entertained for an
instant;&mdash;‘tentative hypotheses,’ as they have been
called. Each of these hypotheses is followed by its
corresponding train of observations, from which it
derives its power of leading to truth. The hypothesis is <span class="pagenum" id="page83">83</span>
like the captain, and the observations like the soldiers
of an army: while he appears to command them, and
in this way to work his own will, he does in fact derive
all his power of conquest from their obedience, and
becomes helpless and useless if they mutiny.</p>
<p class="end">Since the discoverer has thus constantly to work his
way onwards by means of hypotheses, false and true,
it is highly important for him to possess talents and
means for rapidly <em>testing</em> each supposition as it offers
itself. In this as in other parts of the work of discovery,
success has in general been mainly owing to the
native ingenuity and sagacity of the discoverer’s mind.
Yet some Rules tending to further this object have
been delivered by eminent philosophers, and some
others may perhaps be suggested. Of these we shall
here notice only some of the most general, leaving for
a future chapter the consideration of some more
limited and detailed processes by which, in certain
cases, the discovery of the laws of nature may be
materially assisted.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. III.</span>&mdash;<i>Tests of Hypotheses.</i></p>
<p id="b2c5a9">9. A maxim which it may be useful to recollect is
this;&mdash;that <i>hypotheses may often be of service to science,
when they involve a certain portion of incompleteness,
and even of errour</i>. The object of such inventions is to
bind together facts which without them are loose and
detached; and if they do this, they may lead the way
to a perception of the true rule by which the phenomena
are associated together, even if they themselves
somewhat misstate the matter. The imagined arrangement
enables us to contemplate, as a whole, a collection
of special cases which perplex and overload our minds
when they are considered in succession; and if our
scheme has so much of truth in it as to conjoin what is
really connected, we may afterwards duly correct or
limit the mechanism of this connexion. If our hypothesis
renders a reason for the agreement of cases
really similar, we may afterwards find this reason to be <span class="pagenum" id="page84">84</span>
false, but we shall be able to translate it into the
language of truth.</p>
<p>A conspicuous example of such an hypothesis,&mdash;one
which was of the highest value to science, though very
incomplete, and as a representation of nature altogether
false,&mdash;is seen in the <i>Doctrine of epicycles</i> by
which the ancient astronomers explained the motions
of the sun, moon, and planets. This doctrine connected the
places and velocities of these bodies at particular times
in a manner which was, in its general
features, agreeable to nature. Yet this doctrine was
erroneous in its assertion of the <em>circular</em> nature of all
the celestial motions, and in making the heavenly
bodies revolve <em>round the earth</em>. It was, however, of
immense value to the progress of astronomical science;
for it enabled men to express and reason upon many
important truths which they discovered respecting the
motion of the stars, up to the time of Kepler. Indeed
we can hardly imagine that astronomy could, in its
outset, have made so great a progress under any other
form, as it did in consequence of being cultivated in
this shape of the incomplete and false <i>epicyclical hypothesis</i>.</p>
<p>We may notice another instance of an exploded
hypothesis, which is generally mentioned only to be
ridiculed, and which undoubtedly is both false in the
extent of its assertion, and unphilosophical in its
expression; but which still, in its day, was not without
merit. I mean the doctrine of <i>Nature’s horrour
of a vacuum</i> (<i>fuga vacui</i>), by which the action of
siphons and pumps and many other phenomena were
explained, till Mersenne and Pascal taught a truer
doctrine. This hypothesis was of real service; for it
brought together many facts which really belong to
the same class, although they are very different in their
first aspect. A scientific writer of modern
times<a id="fnanchor13-2" href="#note13-2"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>
appears to wonder that men did not at once divine the
weight of the air, from which the phenomena formerly
ascribed to the <i>fuga vacui</i> really result. ‘Loaded, <span class="pagenum" id="page85">85</span>
compressed by the atmosphere,’ he says, ‘they did not
recognize its action. In vain all nature testified that
air was elastic and heavy; they shut their eyes to her
testimony. The water rose in pumps and flowed in
siphons at that time, as it does at this day. They
could not separate the boards of a pair of bellows of
which the holes were stopped; and they could not
bring together the same boards without difficulty, if
they were at first separated. Infants sucked the milk
of their mothers; air entered rapidly into the lungs
of animals at every inspiration; cupping-glasses produced
tumours on the skin; and in spite of all these
striking proofs of the weight and elasticity of the air,
the ancient philosophers maintained resolutely that air
was light, and explained all these phenomena by the
horrour which they said nature had for a vacuum.’
It is curious that it should not have occurred to the
author while writing this, that if these facts, so
numerous and various, can all be accounted for by <em>one</em>
principle, there is a strong presumption that the
principle is not altogether baseless. And in reality is it
not true that nature <em>does</em> abhor a vacuum, and does all
she can to avoid it? No doubt this power is not unlimited;
and moreover we can trace it to a mechanical
cause, the pressure of the circumambient air. But the
tendency, arising from this pressure, which the bodies
surrounding a space void of air have to rush into it,
may be expressed, in no extravagant or unintelligible
manner, by saying that nature has a repugnance to a
vacuum.</p>

</div>
<p>That imperfect and false hypotheses, though they
may thus explain <em>some</em> phenomena, and may be useful
in the progress of science, cannot explain <em>all</em> phenomena;&mdash;and
that we are never to rest in our labours
or acquiesce in our results, till we have found some
view of the subject which <em>is</em> consistent with <em>all</em> the
observed facts;&mdash;will of course be understood. We shall
afterwards have to speak of the other steps of such a
progress.</p>
<p id="b2c5a10">10. Thus the hypotheses which we accept ought to
explain phenomena which we have observed. But they <span class="pagenum" id="page86">86</span>
ought to do more than this: our hypotheses ought to
<em>foretel</em> phenomena which have not yet been observed;
at least all phenomena of the same kind as those which
the hypothesis was invented to explain. For our assent
to the hypothesis implies that it is held to be true of all
particular instances. That these cases belong to past or
to future times, that they have or have not already
occurred, makes no difference in the applicability of the
rule to them. Because the rule prevails, it includes all
cases; and will determine them all, if we can only calculate
its real consequences. Hence it will predict the
results of new combinations, as well as explain the
appearances which have occurred in old ones. And that
it does this with certainty and correctness, is one mode
in which the hypothesis is to be verified as right and
useful.</p>
<p>The scientific doctrines which have at various periods
been established have been verified in this manner.
For example, the <i>Epicyclical Theory</i> of the heavens
was confirmed by its <em>predicting</em> truly eclipses of the
sun and moon, configurations of the planets, and other
celestial phenomena; and by its leading to the construction
of Tables by which the places of the heavenly
bodies were given at every moment of time. The truth
and accuracy of these predictions were a proof that the
hypothesis was valuable, and, at least to a great extent,
true; although, as was afterwards found, it involved a
false representation of the structure of the heavens.
In like manner, the discovery of the <i>Laws of Refraction</i>
enabled mathematicians to <em>predict</em>, by calculation,
what would be the effect of any new form or combination of
transparent lenses. Newton’s hypothesis of
<i>Fits of Easy Transmission and Easy Reflection</i> in the
particles of light, although not confirmed by other
kinds of facts, involved a true statement of the law of
the phenomena which it was framed to include, and
served to <em>predict</em> the forms and colours of thin plates
for a wide range of given cases. The hypothesis that
Light operates by <i>Undulations</i> and <i>Interferences</i>,
afforded the means of <em>predicting</em> results under a still
larger extent of conditions. In like manner in the <span class="pagenum" id="page87">87</span>
progress of chemical knowledge, the doctrine of <i>Phlogiston</i>
supplied the means of <em>foreseeing</em> the consequence
of many combinations of elements, even before they
were tried; but the <i>Oxygen Theory</i>, besides affording
predictions, at least equally exact, with regard to the
general results of chemical operations, included all the
facts concerning the relations of weight of the elements
and their compounds, and enabled chemists to <em>foresee</em>
such facts in untried cases. And the Theory of <i>Electromagnetic
Forces</i>, as soon as it was rightly understood,
enabled those who had mastered it to <em>predict</em> motions
such as had not been before observed, which were
accordingly found to take place.</p>
<p>Men cannot help believing that the laws laid down
by discoverers must be in a great measure identical
with the real laws of nature, when the discoverers thus
determine effects beforehand in the same manner in
which nature herself determines them when the occasion
occurs. Those who can do this, must, to a considerable
extent, have detected nature’s secret;&mdash;must
have fixed upon the conditions to which she attends,
and must have seized the rules by which she applies
them. Such a coincidence of untried facts with speculative
assertions cannot be the work of chance, but implies some
large portion of truth in the principles on
which the reasoning is founded. To trace order and
law in that which has been observed, may be considered
as interpreting what nature has written down for us,
and will commonly prove that we understand her
alphabet. But to predict what has not been observed,
is to attempt ourselves to use the legislative phrases of
nature; and when she responds plainly and precisely
to that which we thus utter, we cannot but suppose
that we have in a great measure made ourselves masters
of the meaning and structure of her language. The
prediction of results, even of the same kind as those
which have been observed, in new cases, is a proof of
real success in our inductive processes.</p>
<p id="b2c5a11">11. We have here spoken of the prediction of
facts <em>of the same kind</em> as those from which our rule
was collected. But the evidence in favour of our <span class="pagenum" id="page88">88</span>
induction is of a much higher and more forcible character
when it enables us to explain and determine
cases of a <em>kind different</em> from those which were contemplated
in the formation of our hypothesis. The
instances in which this has occurred, indeed, impress
us with a conviction that the truth of our hypothesis
is certain. No accident could give rise to such an
extraordinary coincidence. No false supposition could,
after being adjusted to one class of phenomena, exactly
represent a different class, where the agreement was
unforeseen and uncontemplated. That rules springing
from remote and unconnected quarters should thus
leap to the same point, can only arise from <em>that</em> being
the point where truth resides.</p>
<p>Accordingly the cases in which inductions from
classes of facts altogether different have thus <em>jumped
together</em>, belong only to the best established theories
which the history of science contains. And as I shall
have occasion to refer to this peculiar feature in their
evidence, I will take the liberty of describing it by a
particular phrase; and will term it the <i>Consilience of
Inductions</i>.</p>
<p>It is exemplified principally in some of the greatest
discoveries. Thus it was found by Newton that the
doctrine of the Attraction of the Sun varying according
to the Inverse Square of this distance, which explained
Kepler’s <i>Third Law</i>, of the proportionality of
the cubes of the distances to the squares of the periodic
times of the planets, explained also his <i>First</i> and
<i>Second Laws</i>, of the elliptical motion of each planet;
although no connexion of these laws had been visible
before. Again, it appeared that the force of universal
Gravitation, which had been inferred from the <i>Perturbations</i>
of the moon and planets by the sun and by
each other, also accounted for the fact, apparently
altogether dissimilar and remote, of the <i>Precession of
the equinoxes</i>. Here was a most striking and surprising
coincidence, which gave to the theory a stamp
of truth beyond the power of ingenuity to counterfeit.
In like manner in Optics; the hypothesis of alternate
Fits of easy Transmission and Reflection would explain <span class="pagenum" id="page89">89</span>
the colours of thin plates, and indeed was devised and
adjusted for that very purpose; but it could give no
account of the phenomena of the fringes of shadows.
But the doctrine of Interferences, constructed at first
with reference to phenomena of the nature of the
<i>Fringes</i>, explained also the <i>Colours of thin plates</i> better
than the supposition of the Fits invented for that very
purpose. And we have in Physical Optics another
example of the same kind, which is quite as striking
as the explanation of Precession by inferences from the
facts of Perturbation. The doctrine of Undulations
propagated in a Spheroidal Form was contrived at first
by Huyghens, with a view to explain the laws of
<i>Double Refraction</i> in calc-spar; and was pursued with
the same view by Fresnel. But in the course of the
investigation it appeared, in a most unexpected and
wonderful manner, that this same doctrine of spheroidal
undulations, when it was so modified as to
account for the <em>directions</em> of the two refracted rays,
accounted also for the positions of their <i>Planes of
Polarization</i><a id="fnanchor14-2" href="#note14-2"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>,
a phenomenon which, taken by itself,
it had perplexed previous mathematicians, even to
represent.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-2" href="#fnanchor14-2">14</a>
</span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. ix. c. xi. sect. 4.
</div>
<p>The Theory of Universal Gravitation, and of the
Undulatory Theory of Light, are, indeed, full of examples
of this Consilience of Inductions. With regard to
the latter, it has been justly asserted by Herschel, that
the history of the undulatory theory was a succession
of <em>felicities</em><a id="fnanchor15-2" href="#note15-2"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>.
And it is precisely the unexpected
coincidences of results drawn from distant parts of the
subject which are properly thus described. Thus the
Laws of the <i>Modification of polarization</i> to which
Fresnel was led by his general views, accounted for
the Rule respecting the <i>Angle at which light is polarized</i>,
discovered by Sir D.
Brewster<a id="fnanchor16-2" href="#note16-2"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>.
The conceptions of the
theory pointed out peculiar <i>Modifications</i>
of the phenomena when <i>Newton’s rings</i> were produced
by polarised light, which modifications were <span class="pagenum" id="page90">90</span> ascertained
to take place in fact, by Arago and
Airy<a id="fnanchor17-2" href="#note17-2"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>.
When the beautiful phenomena of <i>Dipolarized light</i>
were discovered by Arago and Biot, Young was able
to declare that they were reducible to the general laws
of <i>Interference</i> which he had already
established<a id="fnanchor18-2" href="#note18-2"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>.
And what was no less striking a confirmation of the
truth of the theory, <i>Measures</i> of the same element
deduced from various classes of facts were found to
coincide. Thus the <i>Length</i> of a luminiferous undulation,
calculated by Young from the measurement of
<i>Fringes</i> of shadows, was found to agree very nearly
with the previous calculation from the colours of <i>Thin
plates</i><a id="fnanchor19-2" href="#note19-2"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>.</p>

<p>No example can be pointed out, in the whole history of science,
so far as I am aware, in which this
Consilience of Inductions has given testimony in
favour of an hypothesis afterwards discovered to be
false. If we take one class of facts only, knowing the
law which they follow, we may construct an hypothesis,
or perhaps several, which may represent them:
and as new circumstances are discovered, we may often
adjust the hypothesis so as to correspond to these also.
But when the hypothesis, of itself and without adjustment
for the purpose, gives us the rule and reason of a
class of facts not contemplated in its construction, we
have a criterion of its reality, which has never yet
been produced in favour of falsehood.</p>
<p id="b2c5a12">12. In the preceding Article I have spoken of the
hypothesis with which we compare our facts as being
framed <em>all at once</em>, each of its parts being included in
the original scheme. In reality, however, it often happens
that the various suppositions which our system
contains are <em>added</em> upon occasion of different researches.
Thus in the Ptolemaic doctrine of the heavens, new epicycles
and eccentrics were added as new
inequalities of the motions of the heavenly bodies were
discovered; and in the Newtonian doctrine of material
rays of light, the supposition that these rays had <span class="pagenum" id="page91">91</span>
‘fits,’ was added to explain the colours of thin plates;
and the supposition that they had ‘sides’ was introduced
on occasion of the phenomena of polarization.
In like manner other theories have been built up of
parts devised at different times.</p>
<p>This being the mode in which theories are often
framed, we have to notice a distinction which is found
to prevail in the progress of true and false theories.
In the former class all the additional suppositions <em>tend
to simplicity</em> and harmony; the new suppositions resolve
themselves into the old ones, or at least require
only some easy modification of the hypothesis first
assumed: the system becomes more coherent as it is
further extended. The elements which we require for
explaining a new class of facts are already contained
in our system. Different members of the theory run
together, and we have thus a constant convergence to
unity. In false theories, the contrary is the case. The
new suppositions are something altogether additional;&mdash;not
suggested by the original scheme; perhaps difficult to
reconcile with it. Every such addition adds to
the complexity of the hypothetical system, which at
last becomes unmanageable, and is compelled to surrender
its place to some simpler explanation.</p>
<p>Such a false theory, for example, was the ancient
doctrine of eccentrics and epicycles. It explained the
general succession of the Places of the Sun, Moon,
and Planets; it would not have explained the proportion
of their Magnitudes at different times, if these
could have been accurately observed; but this the ancient
astronomers were unable to do. When, however,
Tycho and other astronomers came to be able to observe
the planets accurately in all positions, it was
found that <em>no</em> combination of <em>equable</em> circular motions
would exactly represent all the observations. We may
see, in Kepler’s works, the many new modifications of
the epicyclical hypothesis which offered themselves to
him; some of which would have agreed with the phenomena
with a certain degree of accuracy, but not with
so great a degree as Kepler, fortunately for the progress
of science, insisted upon obtaining. After these <span class="pagenum" id="page92">92</span>
epicycles had been thus accumulated, they all disappeared
and gave way to the simpler conception of an
<em>elliptical</em> motion. In like manner, the discovery of new
inequalities in the Moon’s motions encumbered her
system more and more with new machinery, which was
at last rejected all at once in favour of the <i>elliptical</i>
theory. Astronomers could not but suppose themselves in
a wrong path, when the prospect grew darker
and more entangled at every step.</p>
<p>Again; the Cartesian system of Vortices might be
said to explain the primary phenomena of the revolutions
of planets about the sun, and satellites about
planets. But the elliptical form of the orbits required
new suppositions. Bernoulli ascribed this curve to the
shape of the planet, operating on the stream of the
vortex in a manner similar to the rudder of a boat.
But then the motions of the aphelia, and of the nodes,&mdash;the
perturbations,&mdash;even the action of gravity towards the
earth,&mdash;could not be accounted for without
new and independent suppositions. Here was none of
the simplicity of truth. The theory of Gravitation,
on the other hand, became more simple as the facts to
be explained became more numerous. The attraction
of the sun accounted for the motions of the planets;
the attraction of the planets was the cause of the motion
of the satellites. But this being assumed, the
perturbations, and the motions of the nodes and aphelia,
only made it requisite to extend the attraction of the
sun to the satellites, and that of the planets to each
other:&mdash;the tides, the spheroidal form of the earth,
the precession, still required nothing more than that
the moon and sun should attract the parts of the earth,
and that these should attract each other;&mdash;so that
all the suppositions resolved themselves into the single
one, of the universal gravitation of all matter. It is
difficult to imagine a more convincing manifestation of
simplicity and unity.</p>
<p>Again, to take an example from another science;&mdash;the
doctrine of Phlogiston brought together many facts
in a very plausible manner,&mdash;combustion, acidification,
and others,&mdash;and very naturally prevailed for a while. <span class="pagenum" id="page93">93</span>
But the balance came to be used in chemical operations,
and the facts of weight as well as of combination
were to be accounted for. On the phlogistic theory, it
appeared that this could not be done without a new
supposition, and <em>that</em>, a very strange one;&mdash;that
phlogiston was an element not only not heavy, but
absolutely light, so that it diminished the weight of the
compounds into which it entered. Some chemists for a
time adopted this extravagant view, but the wiser of
them saw, in the necessity of such a supposition to the
defence of the theory, an evidence that the hypothesis
of an element <i>phlogiston</i> was erroneous. And the
opposite hypothesis, which taught that oxygen was
subtracted, and not phlogiston added, was accepted
because it required no such novel and inadmissible
assumption.</p>
<p>Again, we find the same evidence of truth in the
progress of the Undulatory Theory of light, in the
course of its application from one class of facts to another.
Thus we explain Reflection and Refraction by
undulations; when we come to Thin Plates, the requisite
‘fits’ are already involved in our fundamental
hypothesis, for they are the length of an undulation:
the phenomena of Diffraction also require such intervals;
and the intervals thus required agree exactly
with the others in magnitude, so that no new property
is needed. Polarization for a moment appears to require
some new hypothesis; yet this is hardly the case;
for the direction of our vibrations is hitherto arbitrary:&mdash;we
allow polarization to decide it, and we suppose
the undulations to be transverse. Having done this
for the sake of Polarization, we turn to the phenomena
of Double Refraction, and inquire what new hypothesis
they require. But the answer is, that they require
none: the supposition of transverse vibrations, which
we have made in order to explain Polarization, gives
us also the law of Double Refraction. Truth may give
rise to such a coincidence; falsehood cannot. Again,
the facts of Dipolarization come into view. But they
hardly require any new assumption; for the difference
of optical elasticity of crystals in different directions, <span class="pagenum" id="page94">94</span>
which is already assumed in uniaxal
crystals<a id="fnanchor20-2" href="#note20-2"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>,
is extended to biaxal exactly according to the law of symmetry;
and this being done, the laws of the phenomena, curious and
complex as they are, are fully
explained. The phenomena of Circular Polarization
by internal reflection, instead of requiring a new hypothesis,
are found to be given by an interpretation of
an apparently inexplicable result of an old hypothesis.
The Circular Polarization of Quartz and the Double
Refraction does indeed appear to require a new assumption,
but still not one which at all disturbs the form
of the theory; and in short, the whole history of this
theory is a progress, constant and steady, often striking
and startling, from one degree of evidence and consistence
to another of a higher order.</p>

</div>
<p>In the Emission Theory, on the other hand, as in
the theory of solid epicycles, we see what we may
consider as the natural course of things in the career
of a false theory. Such a theory may, to a certain
extent, explain the phenomena which it was at first
contrived to meet; but every new class of facts requires
a new supposition&mdash;an addition to the machinery: and
as observation goes on, these incoherent appendages
accumulate, till they overwhelm and upset the original
frame-work. Such has been the hypothesis of the
Material Emission of light. In its original form, it
explained Reflection and Refraction: but the colours
of Thin Plates added to it the Fits of easy Transmission and
Reflection; the phenomena of Diffraction
further invested the emitted particles with complex
laws of Attraction and Repulsion; Polarization gave
them Sides: Double Refraction subjected them to
peculiar Forces emanating from the axes of the crystal:
Finally, Dipolarization loaded them with the complex
and unconnected contrivance of Moveable Polarization:
and even when all this had been done, additional
mechanism was wanting. There is here no unexpected
success, no happy coincidence, no convergence of
principles from remote quarters. The philosopher builds <span class="pagenum" id="page95">95</span>
the machine, but its parts do not fit. They hold
together only while he presses them. This is not the
character of truth.</p>
<p>As another example of the application of the Maxim
now under consideration, I may perhaps be allowed to
refer to the judgment which, in the History of Thermotics,
I have ventured to give respecting Laplace’s
Theory of Gases. I have stated<a id="fnanchor21-2" href="#note21-2"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>,
that we cannot help
forming an unfavourable judgment of this theory, by
looking for that great characteristic of true theory;
namely, that the hypotheses which were assumed to
account for <em>one class</em> of facts are found to explain
<em>another class</em> of a different nature. Thus Laplace’s first
suppositions explain the connexion of Compression
with Density, (the law of Boyle and Mariotte,) and
the connexion of Elasticity with Heat, (the law of
Dalton and Gay Lussac). But the theory requires
other assumptions when we come to Latent Heat; and
yet these new assumptions produce no effect upon the
calculations in any application of the theory. When
the hypothesis, constructed with reference to the Elasticity
and Temperature, is applied to another class of
facts, those of Latent Heat, we have no Simplification
of the Hypothesis, and therefore no evidence of the
truth of the theory.</p>

<p id="b2c5a13">13. The last two sections of this chapter direct our
attention to two circumstances, which tend to prove, in
a manner which we may term irresistible, the truth of
the theories which they characterize:&mdash;the <i>Consilience
of Inductions</i> from different and separate classes of
facts;&mdash;and the progressive <i>Simplification of the Theory</i>
as it is extended to new cases. These two Characters
are, in fact, hardly different; they are exemplified by
the same cases. For if these Inductions, collected from
one class of facts, supply an unexpected explanation of
a new class, which is the case first spoken of, there
will be no need for new machinery in the hypothesis
to apply it to the newly-contemplated facts; and thus,
we have a case in which the system does not become <span class="pagenum" id="page96">96</span>
more complex when its application is extended to a
wider field, which was the character of true theory
in its second aspect. The Consiliences of our Inductions
give rise to a constant Convergence of our Theory
towards Simplicity and Unity.</p>
<p class="end">But, moreover, both these cases of the extension of
the theory, without difficulty or new suppositions, to a
wider range and to new classes of phenomena, may be
conveniently considered in yet another point of view;
namely, as successive steps by which we gradually
ascend in our speculative views to a higher and higher
point of generality. For when the theory, either by
the concurrence of two indications, or by an extension
without complication, has included a new range of
phenomena, we have, in fact, a new induction of a
more general kind, to which the inductions formerly
obtained are subordinate, as particular cases to a general
proposition. We have in such examples, in short,
an instance of <i>successive generalization</i>. This is a
subject of great importance, and deserving of being well
illustrated; it will come under our notice in the next
chapter.</p>

<hr class="two" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XVII.</p>
<p><i>The</i> Logic of Induction <i>consists in stating the Facts and
the Inference in such a manner, that the Evidence of the Inference
is manifest: just as the Logic of Deduction consists
in stating the Premises and the Conclusion in such a manner
that the Evidence of the Conclusion is manifest.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XVIII.
<p><i>The Logic of Deduction is exhibited by means of a certain
Formula; namely, a Syllogism; and every train of deductive
reasoning, to be demonstrative, must be capable of resolution
into a series of such Formulæ legitimately constructed. In
like manner, the Logic of Induction may be exhibited by
means of certain</i> Formulæ; <i>and every train of inductive
inference to be sound, must be capable of resolution into a
scheme of such Formulæ, legitimately constructed.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XIX.
<p><i>The</i> inductive act of thought <i>by which several Facts are
colligated into one Proposition, may be expressed by saying:</i>
The several Facts are exactly expressed as one Fact, if,
and only if, we adopt the Conceptions and the Assertion
<i>of the Proposition.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XX.
<p><i>The One Fact, thus inductively obtained from several
Facts, may be combined with other Facts, and colligated
with them by a new act of Induction. This process may be</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page98">98</span>
<i>indefinitely repeated: and these successive processes are the</i>
Steps <i>of Induction, or of</i> Generalization, <i>from the lowest to
the highest.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXI.
<p><i>The relation of the successive Steps of Induction may be
exhibited by means of an</i> Inductive Table, <i>in which the
several Facts are indicated, and tied together by a Bracket,
and the Inductive Inference placed on the other side of the
Bracket; and this arrangement repeated, so as to form a
genealogical Table of each Induction, from the lowest to the
highest.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXII.
<p><i>The Logic of Induction is the</i> Criterion of Truth <i>inferred
from Facts, as the Logic of Deduction is the Criterion of
Truth deduced from necessary Principles. The Inductive
Table enables us to apply such a Criterion; for we can determine
whether each Induction is verified and justified by
the Facts which its Bracket includes; and if each induction
in particular be sound, the highest, which merely combines
them all, must necessarily be sound also.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXIII.
<p><i>The distinction of</i> Fact <i>and</i> Theory <i>is only relative.
Events and phenomena, considered as Particulars which may
be colligated by Induction, are</i> Facts; <i>considered as Generalities
already obtained by colligation of other Facts, they are</i>
Theories. <i>The same event or phenomenon is a Fact or a
Theory, according as it is considered as standing on one side
or the other of the Inductive Bracket.</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="b2c6a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
subject to which the present chapter refers
is described by phrases which are at the present
day familiarly used in speaking of the progress of
knowledge. We hear very frequent mention of <i>ascending
from particular to general</i> propositions, and
from these to propositions still more general;&mdash;of <span class="pagenum" id="page99">99</span>
truths <i>included</i> in other truths of a higher degree of
generality;&mdash;of different <i>stages of generalization</i>;&mdash;and
of the <i>highest step</i> of the process of discovery, to
which all others are subordinate and preparatory. As
these expressions, so familiar to our ears, especially
since the time of Francis Bacon, denote, very significantly,
processes and relations which are of great importance in
the formation of science, it is necessary for
us to give a clear account of them, illustrated with
general exemplifications; and this we shall endeavour
to do.</p>
<p>We have, indeed, already explained that science consists
of Propositions which include the Facts from which
they were collected; and other wider Propositions, collected
in like manner from the former, and including
them. Thus, that the stars, the moon, the sun, rise,
culminate, and set, are facts <em>included</em> in the proposition
that the heavens, carrying with them all the celestial
bodies, have a diurnal revolution about the axis of the
earth. Again, the observed monthly motions of the
moon, and the annual motions of the sun, are <em>included</em>
in certain propositions concerning the movements of
those luminaries with respect to the stars. But all
these propositions are really <em>included</em> in the doctrine
that the earth, revolving on its axis, moves round the
sun, and the moon round the earth. These movements, again,
considered as facts, are explained and
<em>included</em> in the statement of the forces which the earth
exerts upon the moon, and the sun upon the earth.
Again, this doctrine of the forces of these three bodies
is <em>included</em> in the assertion, that all the bodies of the
solar system, and all parts of matter, exert forces, each
upon each. And we might easily show that all the
leading facts in astronomy are comprehended in the
same generalization. In like manner with regard to
any other science, so far as its truths have been well
established and fully developed, we might show that it
consists of a gradation of propositions, proceeding from
the most special facts to the most general theoretical
assertions. We shall exhibit this gradation in some of
the principal branches of science. <span class="pagenum" id="page100">100</span></p>
<p id="b2c6a2">2. This gradation of truths, successively included
in other truths, may be conveniently represented by
Tables resembling the genealogical tables by which the
derivation of descendants from a common ancestor is
exhibited; except that it is proper in this case to invert
the form of the Table, and to make it converge to
unity downwards instead of upwards, since it has for
its purpose to express, not the derivation of many from
one, but the collection of one truth from many things.
Two or more co-ordinate facts or propositions may be
ranged side by side, and joined by some mark of connexion,
(a bracket, as <sub>⏟</sub> or <sup>⎵</sup>,) beneath
which may be placed the more general proposition
which is collected by induction from the former. Again,
propositions co-ordinate with this more general one
may be placed on a level with it; and the combination
of these, and the result of the combination, may be
indicated by brackets in the same manner; and so on,
through any number of gradations. By this means
the streams of knowledge from various classes of facts
will constantly run together into a smaller and smaller
number of channels; like the confluent rivulets of a
great river, coming together from many sources, uniting
their ramifications so as to form larger branches, these
again uniting in a single trunk. The <i>genealogical tree</i>
of each great portion of science, thus formed, will
contain all the leading truths of the science arranged
in their due co-ordination and subordination. Such
Tables, constructed for the sciences of Astronomy and
of Optics, will be given at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p id="b2c6a3">3. The union of co-ordinate propositions into a proposition
of a higher order, which occurs in this Tree of
Science wherever two twigs unite in one branch, is, in
each case, an example of <i>Induction</i>. The single proposition
is collected by the process of induction from
its several members. But here we may observe, that
the image of a mere <em>union</em> of the parts at each of these
points, which the figure of a tree or a river presents, is
very inadequate to convey the true state of the case;
for in Induction, as we have seen, besides mere collection
of particulars, there is always a <em>new conception</em>, a <span class="pagenum" id="page101">101</span>
principle of connexion and unity, supplied by the
mind, and superinduced upon the particulars. There
is not merely a juxta-position of materials, by which
the new proposition contains all that its component
parts contained; but also a formative act exerted by
the understanding, so that these materials are contained
in a new shape. We must remember, therefore, that our
Inductive Tables, although they represent the elements
and the order of these inductive
steps, do not fully represent the whole signification of
the process in each case.</p>
<p id="b2c6a4">4. The principal features of the progress of science
spoken of in the last chapter are clearly exhibited in
these Tables; namely, the <i>Consilience of Inductions</i>
and the constant Tendency to Simplicity observable in
true theories. Indeed in all cases in which, from
propositions of considerable generality, propositions of a
still higher degree are obtained, there is a convergence
of inductions; and if in one of the lines which thus
converge, the steps be rapidly and suddenly made in
order to meet the other line, we may consider that we
have an example of Consilience. Thus when Newton
had collected, from Kepler’s Laws, the Central Force of
the sun, and from these, combined with other facts,
the Universal Force of all the heavenly bodies, he
suddenly turned round to include in his generalization
the Precession of the Equinoxes, which he declared to
arise from the attraction of the sun and moon upon
the protuberant part of the terrestrial spheroid. The
apparent remoteness of this fact, in its nature, from the
other facts with which he thus associated it, causes this
part of his reasoning to strike us as a remarkable example
of <i>Consilience</i>. Accordingly, in the Table of
Astronomy we find that the columns which contain
the facts and theories relative to the <i>sun</i> and <i>planets</i>,
after exhibiting several stages of induction within
themselves, are at length suddenly connected with
a column till then quite distinct, containing the
<i>precession of the equinoxes</i>. In like manner, in the Table
of Optics, the columns which contain the facts and
theories relative to <i>double refraction</i>, and those which
<span class="pagenum" id="page102">102</span> include
<i>polarization by crystals</i>, each go separately
through several stages of induction; and then these
two sets of columns are suddenly connected by Fresnel’s
mathematical induction, that double refraction and
polarization arise from the same cause: thus
exhibiting a remarkable <i>Consilience</i>.</p>
<p id="b2c6a5">5. The constant <i>Tendency to Simplicity</i> in the
sciences of which the progress is thus represented,
appears from the form of the Table itself; for the
single trunk into which all the branches converge,
contains in itself the substance of all the propositions
by means of which this last generalization was arrived
at. It is true, that this ultimate result is sometimes
not so simple as in the Table it appears: for instance,
the ultimate generalization of the Table exhibiting the
progress of Physical Optics,&mdash;namely, that Light consists
in Undulations,&mdash;must be understood as including some other
hypotheses; as, that the undulations
are transverse, that the ether through which they are
propagated has its elasticity in crystals and other
transparent bodies regulated by certain laws; and the
like. Yet still, even acknowledging all the complication
thus implied, the Table in question evidences
clearly enough the constant advance towards unity,
consistency, and simplicity, which have marked the
progress of this Theory. The same is the case in the
Inductive Table of Astronomy in a still greater
degree.</p>
<p id="b2c6a6">6. These Tables naturally afford the opportunity of
assigning to each of the distinct steps of which the
progress of science consists, the name of the <i>Discoverer</i>
to whom it is due. Every one of the inductive
processes which the brackets of our Tables mark,
directs our attention to some person by whom the induction
was first distinctly made. These names I
have endeavoured to put in their due places in the
Tables; and the Inductive Tree of our knowledge in
each science becomes, in this way, an exhibition of the
claims of each discoverer to distinction, and, as it
were, a Genealogical Tree of scientific nobility. It is
by no means pretended that such a tree includes the <span class="pagenum" id="page103">103</span>
names of all the meritorious labourers in each department
of science. Many persons are most usefully
employed in collecting and verifying truths, who do
not advance to any new truths. The labours of a
number of such are included in each stage of our
ascent. But such Tables as we have now before us
will present to us the names of all the most eminent
discoverers: for the main steps of which the progress
of science consists, are transitions from more particular
to more general truths, and must therefore be
rightly given by these Tables; and those must be the
greatest names in science to whom the principal events
of its advance are thus due.</p>
<p id="b2c6a7">7. The Tables, as we have presented them, exhibit
the course by which we pass from Particular to General
through various gradations, and so to the most general.
They display the order of <i>discovery</i>. But by reading
them in an inverted manner, beginning at the single
comprehensive truths with which the Tables end, and
tracing these back into the more partial truths, and
these again into special facts, they answer another
purpose;&mdash;they exhibit the process of <i>verification</i> of
discoveries once made. For each of our general propositions
is true in virtue of the truth of the narrower
propositions which it involves; and we cannot satisfy
ourselves of its truth in any other way than by ascertaining
that these its constituent elements are true.
To assure ourselves that the sun attracts the planets
with forces varying inversely as the square of the distance,
we must analyse by geometry the motion of a
body in an ellipse about the focus, so as to see that such
a motion does imply such a force. We must also verify
those calculations by which the observed places of each
planet are stated to be included in an ellipse. These
calculations involve assumptions respecting the path which
the earth describes about the sun, which assumptions
must again be verified by reference to observation. And
thus, proceeding from step to step, we resolve the most
general truths into their constituent parts; and these
again into their parts; and by testing, at each step, both
the reality of the asserted ingredients and the propriety <span class="pagenum" id="page104">104</span>
of the conjunction, we establish the whole system of
truths, however wide and various it may be.</p>
<p id="b2c6a8">8. It is a very great advantage, in such a mode of
exhibiting scientific truths, that it resolves the verification
of the most complex and comprehensive theories,
into a number of small steps, of which almost any one
falls within the reach of common talents and industry.
That <em>if</em> the particulars of any one step be true, the
generalization also is true, any person with a mind
properly disciplined may satisfy himself by a little
study. That each of these particular propositions <em>is</em>
true, may be ascertained, by the same kind of attention,
when this proposition is resolved into <em>its</em> constituent
and more special propositions. And thus we
may proceed, till the most general truth is broken up
into small and manageable portions. Of these portions,
each may appear by itself narrow and easy; and
yet they are so woven together, by hypothesis and conjunction,
that the truth of the parts necessarily assures
us of the truth of the whole. The verification is of
the same nature as the verification of a large and complex
statement of great sums received by a mercantile
office on various accounts from many quarters. The
statement is separated into certain comprehensive heads,
and these into others less extensive; and these again
into smaller collections of separate articles, each of
which can be inquired into and reported on by separate
persons. And thus at last, the mere addition of
numbers performed by these various persons, and the
summation of the results which they obtain, executed
by other accountants, is a complete and entire security
that there is no errour in the whole of the process.</p>
<p id="b2c6a9">9. This comparison of the process by which we
verify scientific truth to the process of Book-keeping
in a large commercial establishment, may appear to
some persons not sufficiently dignified for the subject.
But, in fact, the possibility of giving this formal and
business-like aspect to the evidence of science, as
involved in the process of successive generalization, is an
inestimable advantage. For if no one could pronounce
concerning a wide and profound theory except he who <span class="pagenum" id="page105">105</span>
could at once embrace in his mind the whole range of
inference, extending from the special facts up to the
most general principles, none but the greatest geniuses
would be entitled to judge concerning the truth or
errour of scientific discoveries. But, in reality, we
seldom need to verify more than one or two steps of
such discoveries at one time; and this may commonly
be done (when the discoveries have been fully established
and developed,) by any one who brings to the
task clear conceptions and steady attention. The progress
of science is gradual: the discoveries which are
successively made, are also verified successively. We
have never any very large collections of them on our
hands at once. The doubts and uncertainties of any
one who has studied science with care and perseverance
are generally confined to a few points. If he can
satisfy himself upon these, he has no misgivings respecting
the rest of the structure; which has indeed
been repeatedly verified by other persons in like manner.
The fact that science is capable of being resolved
into separate processes of verification, is that which
renders it possible to form a great body of scientific
truth, by adding together a vast number of truths, of
which many men, at various times and by multiplied
efforts, have satisfied themselves. The treasury of
Science is constantly rich and abundant, because it
accumulates the wealth which is thus gathered by so
many, and reckoned over by so many more: and the
dignity of Knowledge is no more lowered by the multiplicity
of the tasks on which her servants are employed, and the
narrow field of labour to which some
confine themselves, than the rich merchant is degraded
by the number of offices which it is necessary for him
to maintain, and the minute articles of which he requires
an exact statement from his accountants.</p>
<p id="b2c6a10">10. The analysis of doctrines inductively obtained,
into their constituent facts, and the arrangement of
them in such a form that the conclusiveness of the
induction may be distinctly seen, may be termed the
<i>Logic of Induction</i>. By <i>Logic</i> has generally been
meant a system which teaches us so to arrange our <span class="pagenum" id="page106">106</span>
reasonings that their truth or falsehood shall be evident
in their form. In <em>deductive</em> reasonings, in which
the general principles are assumed, and the question is
concerning their application and combination in particular
cases, the device which thus enables us to judge
whether our reasonings are conclusive is the <i>Syllogism</i>;
and this <i>form</i>, along with the rules which belong to it,
does in fact supply us with a criterion of deductive or
demonstrative reasoning. The <i>Inductive Table</i>, such
as it is presented in the present chapter, in like manner
supplies the means of ascertaining the truth of our
inductive inferences, so far as the form in which our
reasoning may be stated can afford such a criterion. Of
course some care is requisite in order to reduce a train
of demonstration into the form of a series of syllogisms;
and certainly not less thought and attention are required
for resolving all the main doctrines of any great
department of science into a graduated table of co-ordinate
and subordinate inductions. But in each
case, when this task is once executed, the evidence or
want of evidence of our conclusions appears immediately
in a most luminous manner. In each step of
induction, our Table enumerates the particular facts,
and states the general theoretical truth which includes
these and which these constitute. The special act of
attention by which we satisfy ourselves that the facts
<em>are</em> so included,&mdash;that the general truth <em>is</em> so
constituted,&mdash;then affords little room for errour, with
moderate attention and clearness of thought.</p>
<p id="b2c6a11">11. We may find an example of this <i>act of attention</i>
thus required, at any one of the steps of induction
in our Tables; for instance, at the step in the early
progress of astronomy at which it was inferred, that
the earth is a globe, and that the sphere of the heavens
(relatively) performs a diurnal revolution round this
globe of the earth. How was this established in the belief
of the Greeks, and how is it fixed in our conviction?
As to the globular form, we find that as we travel to
the north, the apparent pole of the heavenly motions,
and the constellations which are near it, seem to mount
higher, and as we proceed southwards they descend. <span class="pagenum" id="page107">107</span>
Again, if we proceed from two different points considerably
to the east and west of each other, and travel
directly northwards from each, as from the south of
Spain to the north of Scotland, and from Greece to
Scandinavia, these two north and south lines will be
much nearer to each other in their northern than in
their southern parts. These and similar facts, as soon
as they are clearly estimated and connected in the
mind, are <em>seen to be consistent</em> with a convex surface of
the earth, and with no other: and this notion is further
confirmed by observing that the boundary of the earth’s
shadow upon the moon is always circular; it being
supposed to be already established that the moon receives
her light from the sun, and that lunar eclipses
are caused by the interposition of the earth. As for
the assertion of the (relative) diurnal revolution of the
starry sphere, it is merely putting the visible phenomena
in an exact geometrical form: and thus we establish and
verify the doctrine of the revolution of the sphere of
the heavens about the globe of the earth, by contemplating
it so as to see that it does really and exactly
include the particular facts from which it is collected.</p>
<p>We may, in like manner, illustrate this mode of
verification by any of the other steps of the same Table.
Thus if we take the great Induction of Copernicus, the
heliocentric scheme of the solar system, we find it in the
Table exhibited as including and explaining, <i>first</i>, the
diurnal revolution just spoken of; <i>second</i>, the motions
of the moon among the fixed stars; <i>third</i>, the motions
of the planets with reference to the fixed stars and the
sun; <i>fourth</i>, the motion of the sun in the ecliptic.
And the scheme being clearly conceived, we <em>see</em> that all
the particular facts <em>are</em> faithfully represented by it;
and this agreement, along with the simplicity of the
scheme, in which respect it is so far superior to any
other conception of the solar system, persuade us that
it is really the plan of nature.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, if we attend to any of the
several remarkable discoveries of Newton, which form
the principal steps in the latter part of the Table, as
for instance, the proposition that the sun attracts all <span class="pagenum" id="page108">108</span>
the planets with a force which varies inversely as the
square of the distance, we find it proved by its including
three other propositions previously established;&mdash;<i>first</i>,
that the sun’s mean force on different planets
follows the specified variation (which is proved from
Kepler’s third law); <i>second</i>, that the force by which
each planet is acted upon in different parts of its orbit
tends to the sun (which is proved by the equable description
of areas); <i>third</i>, that this force in different
parts of the same orbit is also inversely as the square
of the distance (which is proved from the elliptical
form of the orbit). And the Newtonian generalization,
when its consequences are mathematically traced,
is <em>seen</em> to agree with each of these particular propositions,
and thus is fully established.</p>
<p id="b2c6a12">12. But when we say that the more general proposition
<em>includes</em> the several more particular ones, we
must recollect what has before been said, that these
particulars form the general truth, not by being merely
enumerated and added together, but by being seen <em>in a
new light</em>. No mere verbal recitation of the particulars
can decide whether the general proposition is true;
a special act of thought is requisite in order to determine
how truly each is included in the supposed induction.
In this respect the Inductive Table is not
like a mere schedule of accounts, where the rightness
of each part of the reckoning is tested by mere addition
of the particulars. On the contrary, the Inductive
truth is never the mere <em>sum</em> of the facts. It is made
into something more by the introduction of a new
mental element; and the mind, in order to be able to
supply this element, must have peculiar endowments
and discipline. Thus looking back at the instances
noticed in the last article, how are we to see that a
convex surface of the earth is necessarily implied by
the convergence of meridians towards the north, or by
the visible descent of the north pole of the heavens as
we travel south? Manifestly the student, in order to
see this, must have clear conceptions of the relations
of space, either naturally inherent in his mind, or
established there by geometrical cultivation,&mdash;by <span class="pagenum" id="page109">109</span>
studying the properties of circles and spheres. When he
is so prepared, he will feel the force of the expressions
we have used, that the facts just mentioned are <em>seen to
be consistent</em> with a globular form of the earth; but
without such aptitude he will not see this consistency:
and if this be so, the mere assertion of it in words
will not avail him in satisfying himself of the truth of
the proposition.</p>
<p>In like manner, in order to perceive the force of the
Copernican induction, the student must have his mind
so disciplined by geometrical studies, or otherwise, that
he sees clearly how absolute motion and relative motion
would alike produce apparent motion. He must have
learnt to cast away all prejudices arising from the seeming
fixity of the earth; and then he will see that there
is nothing which stands in the way of the induction,
while there is much which is on its side. And in the
same manner the Newtonian induction of the law of
the sun’s force from the elliptical form of the orbit,
will be evidently satisfactory to him only who has such
an insight into Mechanics as to see that a curvilinear
path must arise from a constantly deflecting force;
and who is able to follow the steps of geometrical
reasoning by which, from the properties of the ellipse,
Newton proves this deflection to be in the proportion
in which he asserts the force to be. And thus in all
cases the inductive truth must indeed be verified by
comparing it with the particular facts; but then this
comparison is possible for him only whose mind is
properly disciplined and prepared in the use of those
conceptions, which, in addition to the facts, the act of
induction requires.</p>
<p id="b2c6a13">13. In the Tables some indication is given, at
several of the steps, of the act which the mind must
thus perform, besides the mere conjunction of facts, in
order to attain to the inductive truth. Thus in the
cases of the Newtonian inductions just spoken of, the
inferences are stated to be made ‘By Mechanics;’
and in the case of the Copernican induction, it is said
that, ‘By the nature of motion, the apparent motion is
the same, whether the heavens or the earth have a <span class="pagenum" id="page110">110</span>
diurnal motion; and the latter is more simple.’ But
these verbal statements are to be understood as mere
hints<a id="fnanchor22-2" href="#note22-2"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>:
they cannot supersede the necessity of the student’s
contemplating for himself the mechanical principles and the
nature of motion thus referred to.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-2" href="#fnanchor22-2">22</a>
</span> In the Inductive Tables they are marked by an asterisk.
</div>
<p id="b2c6a14">14. In the common or Syllogistic Logic, a certain
<i>Formula</i> of language is used in stating the reasoning,
and is useful in enabling us more readily to apply the
Criterion of Form to alleged demonstrations. This
formula is the usual Syllogism; with its members,
Major Premiss, Minor Premiss, and Conclusion. It
may naturally be asked whether in Inductive Logic
there is any such Formula? whether there is any
standard form of words in which we may most properly
express the inference of a general truth from
particular facts?</p>
<p>At first it might be supposed that the formula of
Inductive Logic need only be of this kind: ‘These
particulars, and all known particulars of the same
kind, are exactly included in the following general
proposition.’ But a moment’s reflection on what has
just been said will show us that this is not sufficient:
for the particulars are not merely <em>included</em> in the
general proposition. It is not enough that they appertain
to it by enumeration. It is, for instance, no adequate
example of Induction to say, ‘Mercury describes
an elliptical path, so does Venus, so do the Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus; therefore all the
Planets describe elliptical paths.’ This is, as we have
seen, the mode of stating the <em>evidence</em> when the proposition
is once suggested; but the Inductive step consists in the
<em>suggestion</em> of a conception not before
apparent. When Kepler, after trying to connect the
observed places of the planet Mars in many other
ways, found at last that the conception of an <i>ellipse</i>
would include them all, he obtained a truth by induction:
for this conclusion was not obviously included
in the phenomena, and had not been applied to these <span class="pagenum" id="page111">111</span>
facts previously. Thus in our Formula, besides stating
that the particulars are included in the general proposition,
we must also imply that the generality is constituted by
a new Conception,&mdash;new at least in its
application.</p>
<p>Hence our Inductive Formula might be something
like the following: ‘These particulars, and all known
particulars of the same kind, are exactly expressed by
adopting the Conceptions and Statement of the following
Proposition.’ It is of course requisite that the
Conceptions should be perfectly clear, and should precisely
embrace the facts, according to the explanation
we have already given of those conditions.</p>
<p id="b2c6a15">15. It may happen, as we have already stated, that
the Explication of a Conception, by which it acquires
its due distinctness, leads to a Definition, which Definition
may be taken as the summary and total result
of the intellectual efforts to which this distinctness is
due. In such cases, the Formula of Induction may be
modified according to this condition; and we may state
the inference by saying, after an enumeration and
analysis of the appropriate facts, ‘These facts are
completely and distinctly expressed by adopting the
following Definition and Proposition.’</p>
<p>This Formula has been adopted in stating the Inductive
Propositions which constitute the basis of the
science of Mechanics, in a work intitled <i>The Mechanical
Euclid</i>. The fundamental truths of the subject
are expressed in <i>Inductive Pairs</i> of Assertions, consisting
each of a Definition and a Proposition, such as
the following:<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Def.</span>&mdash;A <i>Uniform Force</i>
is that which acting in the
direction of the body’s motion, adds or subtracts equal
velocities in equal times.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Prop.</span>&mdash;Gravity is a Uniform Force.<br />
&emsp;Again,<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Def.</span>&mdash;Two <i>Motions</i> are
<i>compounded</i> when each
produces its separate effect in a direction parallel to
itself.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Prop.</span>&mdash;When any Force acts upon a body in motion,
the motion which the Force would produce in the <span class="pagenum" id="page112">112</span>
body at rest is compounded with the previous motion
of the body.<br />
&emsp;And in like manner in other cases.</p>
<p>In these cases the proposition is, of course, established,
and the definition realized, by an enumeration
of the facts. And in the case of inferences made in
such a form, the Definition of the Conception and the
Assertion of the Truth are both requisite and are correlative
to one another. Each of the two steps contains the verification
and justification of the other.
The Proposition derives its meaning from the Definition;
the Definition derives its reality from the Proposition.
If they are separated, the Definition is arbitrary or empty,
the Proposition vague or ambiguous.</p>
<p id="b2c6a16">16. But it must be observed that neither of the
preceding Formulæ expresses the full cogency of the
inductive proof. They declare only that the results
can be clearly explained and rigorously deduced by the
employment of a certain Definition and a certain Proposition.
But in order to make the conclusion demonstrative, which in
perfect examples of Induction it is,
we ought to be able to declare that the results can be
clearly explained and rigorously declared <em>only</em> by the
Definition and Proposition which we adopt. And in
reality, the conviction of the sound inductive reasoner
does reach to this point. The Mathematician asserts
the Laws of Motion, seeing clearly that they (or laws
equivalent to them) afford the only means of clearly
expressing and deducing the actual facts. But this
conviction, that the inductive inference is not only
consistent with the facts, but necessary, finds its place
in the mind gradually, as the contemplation of the
consequences of the proposition, and the various relations
of the facts, becomes steady and familiar. It
is scarcely possible for the student at once to satisfy
himself that the inference is thus inevitable. And
when he arrives at this conviction, he sees also, in
many cases at least, that there may be other ways of
expressing the substance of the truth established,
besides that special Proposition which he has under
his notice. <span class="pagenum" id="page113">113</span></p>
<p>We may, therefore, without impropriety, renounce
the undertaking of conveying in our formula this final
conviction of the necessary truth of our inference. We
may leave it to be thought, without insisting upon saying it,
that in such cases what <em>can</em> be true, <em>is</em> true.
But if we wish to express the ultimate significance of
the Inductive Act of thought, we may take as our
Formula for the Colligation of Facts by Induction,
this:&mdash;‘The several Facts are exactly expressed as one
Fact if, <em>and only if</em>, we adopt the Conception and the
Assertion’ of the inductive inference.</p>
<p id="b2c6a17">17. I have said that the mind must be properly
disciplined in order that it may see the necessary
connexion between the facts and the general proposition
in which they are included. And the perception of
this connexion, though treated as <em>one step</em> in our
inductive inference, may imply <em>many steps</em> of demonstrative
proof. The connexion is this, that the particular case
is included in the general one, that is, may
be <em>deduced</em> from it: but this deduction may often
require many links of reasoning. Thus in the case of
the inference of the law of the force from the elliptical
form of the orbit by Newton, the proof that in the
ellipse the deflection from the tangent is inversely as
the square of the distance from the focus of the ellipse,
is a ratiocination consisting of several steps, and
involving several properties of Conic Sections; these
properties being supposed to be previously established by
a geometrical system of demonstration on the special
subject of the Conic Sections. In this and similar
cases the Induction involves many steps of Deduction.
And in such cases, although the Inductive Step, the
Invention of the Conception, is really the most important,
yet since, when once made, it occupies a
familiar place in men’s minds; and since the Deductive
Demonstration is of considerable length and requires
intellectual effort to follow it at every step; men often
admire the deductive part of the proposition, the geometrical
or algebraical demonstration, far more than
that part in which the philosophical merit really resides. <span class="pagenum" id="page114">114</span></p>
<p id="b2c6a18">18. Deductive reasoning is virtually a collection of
syllogisms, as has already been stated: and in such
reasoning, the general principles, the Definitions and
Axioms, necessarily stand at the <em>beginning</em> of the
demonstration. In an inductive inference, the Definitions
and Principles are the <em>final result</em> of the reasoning,
the ultimate effect of the proof. Hence when an
Inductive Proposition is to be established by a proof
involving several steps of demonstrative reasoning, the
enunciation of the Proposition will contain, explicitly
or implicitly, principles which the demonstration proceeds
upon as axioms, but which are really inductive
inferences. Thus in order to prove that the force
which retains a planet in an ellipse varies inversely as
the square of the distance, it is taken for granted that
the Laws of Motion are true, and that they apply to
the planets. Yet the doctrine that this is so, as well
as the law of the force, were established only by this and
the like demonstrations. The doctrine which is the
<em>hypothesis</em> of the deductive reasoning, is the <em>inference</em>
of the inductive process. The special facts which are
the basis of the inductive inference, are the conclusion
of the train of deduction. And in this manner the
deduction establishes the induction. The principle
which we gather from the facts is true, because the
facts can be derived from it by rigorous demonstration.
Induction moves upwards, and deduction downwards,
on the same stair.</p>
<p>But still there is a great difference in the character
of their movements. Deduction descends steadily and
methodically, step by step: Induction mounts by a
leap which is out of the reach of method. She bounds
to the top of the stair at once; and then it is the
business of Deduction, by trying each step in order, to
establish the solidity of her companion’s footing. Yet
these must be processes of the same mind. The Inductive
Intellect makes an assertion which is subsequently
justified by demonstration; and it shows its
sagacity, its peculiar character, by enunciating the
proposition when as yet the demonstration does not <span class="pagenum" id="page115">115</span>
exist: but then it shows that it <em>is</em> sagacity, by also
producing the demonstration.</p>
<p>It has been said that inductive and deductive reasoning
are contrary in their scheme; that in Deduction
we infer particular from general truths; while in
Induction we infer general from particular: that
Deduction consists of many steps, in each of which we apply
known general propositions in particular cases; while
in Induction we have a single step, in which we pass
from many particular truths to one general proposition.
And this is truly said; but though contrary
in their motions, the two are the operation of the same
mind travelling over the same ground. Deduction is
a necessary part of Induction. Deduction justifies by
calculation what Induction had happily guessed. Induction
recognizes the ore of truth by its weight;
Deduction confirms the recognition by chemical analysis.
Every step of Induction must be confirmed by
rigorous deductive reasoning, followed into such detail
as the nature and complexity of the relations (whether
of quantity or any other) render requisite. If not so
justified by the supposed discoverer, it is <em>not</em> Induction.</p>
<p id="b2c6a19">19. Such Tabular arrangements of propositions as
we have constructed may be considered as the <i>Criterion
of Truth</i> for the doctrines which they include. They
are the Criterion of Inductive Truth, in the same
sense in which Syllogistic Demonstration is the Criterion
of Necessary Truth,&mdash;of the certainty of conclusions,
depending upon evident First Principles.
And that such Tables are really a Criterion of the
truth of the propositions which they contain, will be
plain by examining their structure. For if the connexion
which the inductive process assumes be ascertained
to be in each case real and true, the assertion of
the general proposition merely collects together
ascertained truths; and in like manner each of those more
particular propositions is true, because it merely
expresses collectively more special facts: so that the most
general theory is only the assertion of a great body
of facts, duly classified and subordinated. When we <span class="pagenum" id="page116">116</span>
assert the truth of the Copernican theory of the motions
of the solar system, or of the Newtonian theory of the
forces by which they are caused, we merely assert the
groups of propositions which, in the Table of Astronomical
Induction, are included in these doctrines; and
ultimately, we may consider ourselves as merely asserting
at once so many Facts, and therefore, of course,
expressing an indisputable truth.</p>
<p id="b2c6a20">20. At any one of these steps of Induction in the
Table, the inductive proposition is a <em>Theory</em> with
regard to the Facts which it includes, while it is to be
looked upon as a <em>Fact</em> with respect to the higher
generalizations in which it is included. In any other
sense, as was formerly shown, the opposition of <em>Fact</em>
and <em>Theory</em> is untenable, and leads to endless perplexity
and debate. Is it a Fact or a Theory that the
planet Mars revolves in an Ellipse about the Sun?
To Kepler, employed in endeavouring to combine the
separate observations by the Conception of an Ellipse,
it is a Theory; to Newton, engaged in inferring the
law of force from a knowledge of the elliptical motion,
it is a Fact. There are, as we have already seen, no
special attributes of Theory and Fact which distinguish
them from one another. Facts are phenomena apprehended
by the aid of conceptions and mental acts, as
Theories also are. We commonly call our observations
<i>Facts</i>, when we apply, without effort or consciousness,
conceptions perfectly familiar to us: while we speak of
Theories, when we have previously contemplated the
Facts and the connecting Conception separately, and
have made the connexion by a conscious mental act.
The real difference is a difference of relation; as the
same proposition in a demonstration is the <em>premiss</em> of
one syllogism and the <em>conclusion</em> in another;&mdash;as the
same person is a father and a son. Propositions are
Facts and Theories, according as they stand above or
below the Inductive Brackets of our Tables.</p>
<p id="b2c6a21">21. To obviate mistakes I may remark that the
terms <i>higher</i> and <i>lower</i>, when used of generalizations,
are unavoidably represented by their opposites in our
Inductive Tables. The highest generalization is that <span class="pagenum" id="page117">117</span>
which includes all others; and this stands the lowest
on our page, because, reading downwards, that is the
place which we last reach.</p>
<p class="end">There is a distinction of the knowledge acquired by
Scientific Induction into two kinds, which is so important
that we shall consider it in the succeeding
chapter.</p>

<p><i>Inductive truths are of two kinds</i>, Laws of Phenomena,
<i>and</i> Theories of Causes. <i>It is necessary to begin in every
science with the Laws of Phenomena; but it is impossible that
we should be satisfied to stop short of a Theory of Causes. In
Physical Astronomy, Physical Optics, Geology, and other
sciences, we have instances showing that we can make a great
advance in inquiries after true Theories of Causes.</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="b2c7a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N
the first attempts at acquiring an exact and
connected knowledge of the appearances and operations
which nature presents, men went no further
than to learn <em>what</em> takes place, not <em>why</em> it occurs.
They discovered an Order which the phenomena follow,
Rules which they obey; but they did not come in
sight of the Powers by which these rules are determined,
the Causes of which this order is the effect.
Thus, for example, they found that many of the celestial
motions took place as if the sun and stars were
carried round by the revolutions of certain celestial
spheres; but what causes kept these spheres in constant
motion, they were never able to explain. In
like manner in modern times, Kepler discovered that
the planets describe ellipses, before Newton explained
why they select this particular curve, and describe it
in a particular manner. The laws of reflection, refraction,
dispersion, and other properties of light have
long been known; the causes of these laws are at
present under discussion. And the same might be <span class="pagenum" id="page119">119</span>
said of many other sciences. The discovery of <i>the
Laws of Phenomena</i> is, in all cases, the first step in
exact knowledge; these Laws may often for a long
period constitute the whole of our science; and it is
always a matter requiring great talents and great efforts,
to advance to a knowledge of the <i>Causes</i> of the
phenomena.</p>
<p>Hence the larger part of our knowledge of nature,
at least of the certain portion of it, consists of the
knowledge of the Laws of Phenomena. In Astronomy
indeed, besides knowing the rules which guide the appearances,
and resolving them into the real motions
from which they arise, we can refer these motions to
the forces which produce them. In Optics, we have
become acquainted with a vast number of laws by
which varied and beautiful phenomena are governed;
and perhaps we may assume, since the evidence of the
Undulatory Theory has been so fully developed, that
we know also the Causes of the Phenomena. But in
a large class of sciences, while we have learnt many
Laws of Phenomena, the causes by which these are
produced are still unknown or disputed. Are we to
ascribe to the operation of a fluid or fluids, and if so,
in what manner, the facts of heat, magnetism, electricity,
galvanism? What are the forces by which the
elements of chemical compounds are held together?
What are the forces, of a higher order, as we cannot
help believing, by which the course of vital action in
organized bodies is kept up? In these and other cases,
we have extensive departments of science; but we are
as yet unable to trace the effects to their causes; and
our science, so far as it is positive and certain, consists
entirely of the laws of phenomena.</p>
<p id="b2c7a2">2. In those cases in which we have a division of
the science which teaches us the doctrine of the causes,
as well as one which states the rules which the effects
follow, I have, in the <i>History</i>, distinguished the two
portions of the science by certain terms. I have thus
spoken of <i>Formal</i> Astronomy and <i>Physical</i> Astronomy.
The latter phrase has long been commonly employed to
describe that department of Astronomy which deals with <span class="pagenum" id="page120">120</span>
those forces by which the heavenly bodies are guided in
their motions; the former adjective appears well suited
to describe a collection of rules depending on those ideas
of space, time, position, number, which are, as we have
already said, the <i>forms</i> of our apprehension of phenomena.
The laws of phenomena may be considered as
<i>formulæ</i>, expressing results in terms of those ideas.
In like manner, I have spoken of Formal Optics and
Physical Optics; the latter division including all
speculations concerning the machinery by which the
effects are produced. Formal Acoustics and Physical
Acoustics may be distinguished in like manner, although
these two portions of science have been a good
deal mixed together by most of those who have treated
of them. Formal Thermotics, the knowledge of the
laws of the phenomena of heat, ought in like manner
to lead to Physical Thermotics, or the Theory of Heat
with reference to the cause by which its effects are
produced;&mdash;a branch of science which as yet can hardly
be said to exist.</p>
<p id="b2c7a3">3. What <em>kinds of cause</em> are we to admit in science?
This is an important, and by no means an easy question.
In order to answer it, we must consider in what
manner our progress in the knowledge of causes has
hitherto been made. By far the most conspicuous instance
of success in such researches, is the discovery
of the causes of the motions of the heavenly bodies.
In this case, after the formal laws of the motions,&mdash;their
conditions as to space and time,&mdash;had become
known, men were enabled to go a step further; to reduce
them to the familiar and general cause of motion&mdash;mechanical
force; and to determine the laws which
this force follows. That this was a step in addition to
the knowledge previously possessed, and that it was a
real and peculiar truth, will not be contested. And a
step in any other subject which should be analogous to
this in astronomy;&mdash;a discovery of causes and forces
as certain and clear as the discovery of universal
gravitation;&mdash;would undoubtedly be a vast advance upon
a body of science consisting only of the laws of phenomena. <span class="pagenum" id="page121">121</span></p>
<p id="b2c7a4">4. But although physical astronomy may well be
taken as a standard in estimating the value and magnitude
of the advance from the knowledge of phenomena to the
knowledge of causes; the peculiar features
of the transition from formal to physical science in
that subject must not be allowed to limit too narrowly
our views of the nature of this transition in other
cases. We are not, for example, to consider that the
step which leads us to the knowledge of causes in any
province of nature must necessarily consist in the
discovery of centers of forces, and collections of
such centers, by which the effects are produced. The discovery
of the causes of phenomena may imply the detection
of a fluid by whose undulations, or other operations,
the results are occasioned. The phenomena of acoustics
are, we know, produced in this manner by the air;
and in the cases of light, heat, magnetism, and others,
even if we reject all the theories of such fluids which
have hitherto been proposed, we still cannot deny that
such theories are intelligible and possible, as the
discussions concerning them have shown. Nor can it be
doubted that if the assumption of such a fluid, in any
case, were as well evidenced as the doctrine of universal
gravitation is, it must be considered as a highly
valuable theory.</p>
<p id="b2c7a5">5. But again; not only must we, in aiming at the
formation of a Causal Section in each Science of Phenomena,
consider Fluids and their various modes of
operation admissible, as well as centers of mechanical
force; but we must be prepared, if it be necessary, to
consider the forces, or powers to which we refer the
phenomena, under still more general aspects, and invested
with characters different from mere mechanical
force. For example; the forces by which the chemical
elements of bodies are bound together, and from which
arise, both their sensible texture, their crystalline form,
and their chemical composition, are certainly forces of
a very different nature from the mere attraction of
matter according to its mass. The powers of assimilation
and reproduction in plants and animals are obviously
still more removed from mere mechanism; yet <span class="pagenum" id="page122">122</span>
these powers are not on that account less real, nor a
less fit and worthy subject of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p id="b2c7a6">6. In fact, these forces&mdash;mechanical, chemical and
vital,&mdash;as we advance from one to the other, each bring
into our consideration new characters; and what these
characters are, has appeared in the historical survey
which we made of the Fundamental Ideas of the various
sciences. It was then shown that the forces by which
chemical effects are produced necessarily involve the
Idea of Polarity,&mdash;they are polar forces; the particles
tend together in virtue of opposite properties which in
the combination neutralize each other. Hence, in attempting
to advance to a theory of Causes in chemistry,
our task is by no means to invent laws of <i>mechanical</i>
force, and collections of forces, by which the effects
may be produced. We know beforehand that no such
attempt can succeed. Our aim must be to conceive
such new kinds of force, including Polarity among
their characters, as may best render the results intelligible.</p>
<p id="b2c7a7">7. Thus in advancing to a Science of Cause in any
subject, the labour and the struggle is, not to analyse
the phenomena according to any preconceived and
already familiar ideas, but to form distinctly new
conceptions, such as do really carry us to a more intimate
view of the processes of nature. Thus in the case of
astronomy, the obstacle which deferred the discovery
of the true causes from the time of Kepler to that of
Newton, was the difficulty of taking hold of mechanical
conceptions and axioms with sufficient clearness and
steadiness; which, during the whole of that interval,
mathematicians were learning to do. In the question
of causation which now lies most immediately in the
path of science, that of the causes of electrical and
chemical phenomena, the business of rightly fixing and
limiting the conception of polarity, is the proper object
of the efforts of discoverers. Accordingly a large portion
of Mr Faraday’s recent
labours<a id="fnanchor23-2" href="#note23-2"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>
is directed, not to <span class="pagenum" id="page123">123</span>
the attempt at discovering new laws of phenomena, but
to the task of throwing light upon the conception of
polarity, and of showing how it must be understood, so
that it shall include electrical induction and other phenomena,
which have commonly been ascribed to forces
acting mechanically at a distance. He is by no means
content, nor would it answer the ends of science that
he should be, with stating the results of his experiments;
he is constantly, in every page, pointing out
the interpretation of his experiments, and showing how
the conception of Polar Forces enters into this interpretation.
‘I shall,’ he says<a id="fnanchor24-2" href="#note24-2"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>,
‘use every opportunity
which presents itself of returning to that strong test of
truth, experiment; but,’ he adds, ‘I shall necessarily
have occasion to speak theoretically, and even hypothetically.’
His hypothesis that electrical inductive
action always takes place by means of a continuous line
of polarized particles, and not by attraction and repulsion
at a distance, if established, cannot fail to be a
great step on our way towards a knowledge of causes,
as well as phenomena, in the subjects under his consideration.</p>

<p id="b2c7a8">8. The process of obtaining new conceptions is, to
most minds, far more unwelcome than any labour in
employing old ideas. The effort is indeed painful and
oppressive; it is feeling in the dark for an object which
we cannot find. Hence it is not surprising that we
should far more willingly proceed to seek for new causes
by applying conceptions borrowed from old ones. Men
were familiar with solid frames, and with whirlpools of
fluid, when they had not learnt to form any clear conception
of attraction at a distance. Hence they at
first imagined the heavenly motions to be caused by
Crystalline Spheres, and by Vortices. At length they
were taught to conceive Central Forces, and then they
reduced the solar system to these. But having done
this, they fancied that all the rest of the machinery of
nature must be central forces. We find Newton <span class="pagenum" id="page124">124</span>
expressing this conviction<a id="fnanchor25-2" href="#note25-2"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>,
and the mathematicians of
the last century acted upon it very extensively. We
may especially remark Laplace’s labours in this field.
Having explained, by such forces, the phenomena of
capillary attraction, he attempted to apply the same
kind of explanation to the reflection, refraction, and
double refraction of light;&mdash;to the constitution of
gases;&mdash;to the operation of heat. It was soon seen that
the explanation of refraction was arbitrary, and that
of double refraction illusory; while polarization entirely
eluded the grasp of this machinery. Centers of force
would no longer represent the modes of causation
which belonged to the phenomena. Polarization required
some other contrivance, such as the undulatory
theory supplied. No theory of light can be of any
avail in which the fundamental idea of Polarity is not
clearly exhibited.</p>

<p id="b2c7a9">9. The sciences of magnetism and electricity have
given rise to theories in which this relation of polarity
is exhibited by means of two opposite
fluids<a id="fnanchor26-2" href="#note26-2"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>;&mdash;a
positive and a negative fluid, or a vitreous and a resinous,
for electricity, and a boreal and an austral fluid
for magnetism. The hypothesis of such fluids gives
results agreeing in a remarkable manner with the
facts and their measures, as Coulomb and others have
shown. It may be asked how far we may, in such a
case, suppose that we have discovered the true cause of
the phenomena, and whether it is sufficiently proved
that these fluids really exist. The right answer seems
to be, that the hypothesis certainly represents the
truth so far as regards the polar relation of the two
energies, and the laws of the attractive and repulsive
forces of the particles in which these energies reside;
but that we are not entitled to assume that the vehicles
of these energies possess other attributes of material
fluids, or that the forces thus ascribed to the
particles are the primary elementary forces from which <span class="pagenum" id="page125">125</span>
the action originates. We are the more bound to
place this cautious limit to our acceptance of the Coulombian
theory, since in electricity Faraday has in
vain endeavoured to bring into view one of the polar
fluids without the other: whereas such a result ought
to be possible if there were two separable fluids. The
impossibility of this separate exhibition of one fluid
appears to show that the fluids are <em>real</em> only so far as
they are <em>polar</em>. And Faraday’s view above mentioned,
according to which the attractions at a distance are
resolved into the action of lines of polarized particles
of air, appears still further to show that the conceptions
hitherto entertained of electrical forces, according
to the Coulombian theory, do not penetrate to the real
and intimate nature of the causation belonging to this
case.</p>

</div>
<p id="b2c7a10">10. Since it is thus difficult to know when we have
seized the true cause of the phenomena in any department
of science, it may appear to some persons that
physical inquirers are imprudent and unphilosophical
in undertaking this Research of Causes; and that it
would be safer and wiser to confine ourselves to the
investigation of the laws of phenomena, in which field
the knowledge which we obtain is definite and certain.
Hence there have not been wanting those who have
laid it down as a maxim that ‘science must study only
the laws of phenomena, and never the mode of
production<a id="fnanchor27-2" href="#note27-2"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>.’
But it is easy to see that such a maxim would
confine the breadth and depth of scientific inquiries to
a most scanty and miserable limit. Indeed, such a
rule would defeat its own object; for the laws of phenomena,
in many cases, cannot be even expressed or
understood without some hypothesis respecting their
mode of production. How could the phenomena of
polarization have been conceived or reasoned upon,
except by imagining a polar arrangement of particles,
or transverse vibrations, or some equivalent hypothesis?
The doctrines of fits of easy transmission, the doctrine
of moveable polarization, and the like, even when <span class="pagenum" id="page126">126</span>
erroneous as representing the whole of the phenomena,
were still useful in combining some of them into laws;
and without some such hypotheses the facts could not
have been followed out. The doctrine of a fluid caloric
may be false; but without imagining such a fluid, how
could the movement of heat from one part of a body to
another be conceived? It may be replied that Fourier,
Laplace, Poisson, who have principally cultivated the
Theory of Heat, have not conceived it as a fluid, but
have referred conduction to the radiation of the molecules
of bodies, which they suppose to be separate points.
But this molecular constitution of bodies is itself an
assumption of the mode in which the phenomena are
produced; and the radiation of heat suggests inquiries
concerning a fluid emanation, no less than its conduction
does. In like manner, the attempts to connect
the laws of phenomena of heat and of gases, have led
to hypotheses respecting the constitution of gases, and
the combination of their particles with those of caloric,
which hypotheses may be false, but are probably the
best means of discovering the truth.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-2" href="#fnanchor27-2">27</a>
</span> Comte, <i>Philosophie Positive</i>.
</div>
<p>To debar science from inquiries like these, on the
ground that it is her business to inquire into facts,
and not to speculate about causes, is a curious example
of that barren caution which hopes for truth without
daring to venture upon the quest of it. This temper
would have stopped with Kepler’s discoveries, and
would have refused to go on with Newton to inquire
into the mode in which the phenomena are produced.
It would have stopped with Newton’s optical facts,
and would have refused to go on with him and his
successors to inquire into the mode in which these
phenomena are produced. And, as we have abundantly
shown, it would, on that very account, have failed in
seeing what the phenomena really are.</p>
<p>In many subjects the attempt to study the laws of
phenomena, independently of any speculations respecting
the causes which have produced them, is neither
possible for human intelligence nor for human temper.
Men cannot contemplate the phenomena without
clothing them in terms of some hypothesis, and will <span class="pagenum" id="page127">127</span>
not be schooled to suppress the questionings which at
every moment rise up within them concerning the
causes of the phenomena. Who can attend to the
appearances which come under the notice of the geologist;&mdash;strata
regularly bedded, full of the remains of
animals such as now live in the depths of the ocean,
raised to the tops of mountains, broken, contorted,
mixed with rocks such as still flow from the mouths of
volcanos,&mdash;who can see phenomena like these, and
imagine that he best promotes the progress of our
knowledge of the earth’s history, by noting down the
facts, and abstaining from all inquiry whether these
are really proof of past states of the earth and of
subterraneous forces, or merely an accidental imitation of
the effects of such causes? In this and similar cases,
to proscribe the inquiry into causes would be to annihilate the science.</p>
<p>Finally, this caution does not even gain its own
single end, the escape from hypotheses. For, as we
have said, those who will not seek for new and appropriate
causes of newly-studied phenomena, are almost
inevitably led to ascribe the facts to modifications of
causes already familiar. They may declare that they
will not hear of such causes as vital powers, elective
affinities, electric, or calorific, or luminiferous ethers or
fluids; but they will not the less on that account
assume hypotheses equally unauthorized;&mdash;for instance&mdash;universal
mechanical forces; a molecular constitution of bodies;
solid, hard, inert matter;&mdash;and will
apply these hypotheses in a manner which is arbitrary
in itself as well as quite insufficient for its purpose.</p>
<p id="b2c7a11">11. It appears, then, to be required, both by the
analogy of the most successful efforts of science in past
times and by the irrepressible speculative powers of
the human mind, that we should attempt to discover
both the <em>laws of phenomena</em>, and their <em>causes</em>. In every
department of science, when prosecuted far enough,
these two great steps of investigation must succeed
each other. The laws of phenomena must be known
before we can speculate concerning causes; the causes
must be inquired into when the phenomena have been <span class="pagenum" id="page128">128</span>
reduced to rule. In both these speculations the suppositions
and conceptions which occur must be constantly tested by
reference to observation and experiment. In both we must,
as far as possible, devise
hypotheses which, when we thus test them, display
those characters of truth of which we have already
spoken;&mdash;an agreement with facts such as will stand
the most patient and rigid inquiry; a provision for
predicting truly the results of untried cases; a consilience
of inductions from various classes of facts; and
a progressive tendency of the scheme to simplicity and
unity.</p>
<p class="end">We shall attempt hereafter to give several rules of a
more precise and detailed kind for the discovery of the
causes, and still more, of the laws of phenomena. But
it will be useful in the first place to point out the
Classification of the Sciences which results from the
principles already established in this
<span class="correction" title="emended from word">work</span>. And for
this purpose we must previously decide the question,
whether the practical Arts, as Medicine and Engineering,
must be included in our list of Sciences.</p>

<p><i>Art and Science differ. The object of Science is Knowledge;
the objects of Art, are Works. In Art, truth is a
means to an end; in Science, it is the only end. Hence the
Practical Arts are not to be classed among the Sciences.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXVI.</p>
<p><i>Practical Knowledge, such as Art implies, is not Knowledge
such as Science includes. Brute animals have a practical
knowledge of relations of space and force; but they have
no knowledge of Geometry or Mechanics.</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="b2c8a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
distinction of Arts and Sciences very materially
affects all classifications of the departments
of Human Knowledge. It is often maintained, expressly or
tacitly, that the Arts are a part of our
knowledge, in the same sense in which the Sciences
are so; and that Art is the application of Science to the
purposes of practical life. It will be found that these
views require some correction, when we understand
<i>Science</i> in the exact sense in which we have throughout
endeavoured to contemplate it, and in which alone
our examination of its nature can instruct us in the
true foundations of our knowledge.</p>
<p>When we cast our eyes upon the early stages of
the histories of nations, we cannot fail to be struck
with the consideration, that in many countries the
Arts of life already appear, at least in some rude form
or other, when, as yet, nothing of science exists. A <span class="pagenum" id="page130">130</span>
practical knowledge of Astronomy, such as enables them
to reckon months and years, is found among all nations
except the mere savages. A practical knowledge of
Mechanics must have existed in those nations which
have left us the gigantic monuments of early architecture.
The pyramids and temples of Egypt and Nubia,
the Cyclopean walls of Italy and Greece, the temples
of Magna Græcia and Sicily, the obelisks and edifices
of India, the cromlechs and Druidical circles of countries
formerly Celtic,&mdash;must have demanded no small
practical mechanical skill and power. Yet those
modes of reckoning time must have preceded the rise
of speculative Astronomy; these structures must have
been erected before the theory of Mechanics was
known. To suppose, as some have done, a great body
of science, now lost, to have existed in the remote
ages to which these remains belong, is not only quite
gratuitous, and contrary to all analogy, but is a
supposition which cannot be extended so far as to explain
all such cases. For it is impossible to imagine that
<em>every</em> art has been preceded by the science which
renders a reason for its processes. Certainly men formed
wine from the grape, before they possessed a Science of
Fermentation; the first instructor of every artificer in
brass and iron can hardly be supposed to have taught
the Chemistry of metals as a Science; the inventor
of the square and the compasses had probably no more
knowledge of demonstrated Geometry than have the
artisans who now use those implements; and finally,
the use of speech, the employment of the inflections
and combinations of words, must needs be assumed as
having been prior to any general view of the nature
and analogy of Language. Even at this moment, the
greater part of the arts which exist in the world are
not accompanied by the sciences on which they theoretically
depend. Who shall state to us the general
chemical truths to which the manufactures of glass,
and porcelain, and iron, and brass, owe their existence?
Do not almost all artisans practise many successful
artifices long before science explains the ground of the
process? Do not arts at this day exist, in a high state <span class="pagenum" id="page131">131</span>
of perfection, in countries in which there is no science,
as China and India? These countries and many others
have no theories of mechanics, of optics, of chemistry,
of physiology; yet they construct and use mechanical
and optical instruments, make chemical combinations,
take advantage of physiological laws. It is too evident
to need further illustration that Art may exist without
Science;&mdash;that the former has usually been anterior to
the latter, and even now commonly advances independently,
leaving science to follow as it can.</p>
<p id="b2c8a2">2. We here mean by <i>Science</i>, that exact, general,
speculative knowledge, of which we have, throughout
this work, been endeavouring to exhibit the nature
and rules. Between such Science and the <i>practical
Arts</i> of life, the points of difference are sufficiently
manifest. The object of Science is <em>Knowledge</em>; the
object of Art are <em>Works</em>. The latter is satisfied with
producing its material results; to the former, the
operations of matter, whether natural or artificial, are
interesting only so far as they can be embraced by
intelligible principles. The End of Art is the Beginning
of Science; for when it is seen <em>what</em> is done, then
comes the question <em>why</em> it is done. Art may have
fixed general rules, stated in words; but she has
these merely as means to an end: to Science, the propositions
which she obtains are each, in itself, a sufficient end of
the effort by which it is acquired. When
Art has brought forth her product, her task is finished;
Science is constantly led by one step of her path to
another: each proposition which she obtains impels
her to go onwards to other propositions more general,
more profound, more simple. Art puts elements together,
without caring to know what they are, or why
they coalesce. Science analyses the compound, and at
every such step strives not only to perform, but to
understand the analysis. Art advances in proportion
as she becomes able to bring forth products more
multiplied, more complex, more various; but Science,
straining her eyes to penetrate more and more deeply
into the nature of things, reckons her success in
proportion as she sees, in all the phenomena, however <span class="pagenum" id="page132">132</span>
multiplied; complex, and varied, the results of one or
two simple and general laws.</p>
<p id="b2c8a3">3. There are many acts which man, as well as
animals, performs by the guidance of nature, without
seeing or seeking the reason why he does so; as, the
acts by which he balances himself in standing or
moving, and those by which he judges of the form and
position of the objects around him. These actions
have their reason in the principles of geometry and
mechanics; but of such reasons he who thus acts is
unaware: he works blindly, under the impulse of an
unknown principle which we call <i>Instinct</i>. When
man’s speculative nature seeks and finds the reasons
why he should act thus or thus;&mdash;why he should
stretch out his arm to prevent his falling, or assign a
certain position to an object in consequence of the
angles under which it is seen;&mdash;he may perform the
same actions as before, but they are then done by the
aid of a different faculty, which, for the sake of
distinction, we may call <i>Insight</i>. Instinct is a purely
active principle; it is seen in deeds alone; it has no
power of looking inwards; it asks no questions; it has
no tendency to discover reasons or rules; it is the
opposite of Insight.</p>
<p id="b2c8a4">4. Art is not identical with Instinct: on the contrary,
there are broad differences. Instinct is stationary;
Art is progressive. Instinct is mute; it acts,
but gives no rules for acting: Art can speak; she can
lay down rules. But though Art is thus separate
from Instinct, she is not essentially combined with
Insight. She can see what to do, but she needs not
to see why it is done. She may lay down Rules, but it
is not her business to give Reasons. When man makes
<em>that</em> his employment, he enters upon the domain of
Science. Art takes the phenomena and laws of nature
as she finds them: that they are multiplied, complex,
capricious, incoherent, disturbs her not. She is content
that the rules of nature’s operations should be
perfectly arbitrary and unintelligible, provided they
are constant, so that she can depend upon their effects.
But Science is impatient of all appearance of caprice, <span class="pagenum" id="page133">133</span>
inconsistency, irregularity, in nature. She will not
believe in the existence of such characters. She resolves
one apparent anomaly after another; her task is
not ended till every thing is so plain and simple, that
she is tempted to believe that she sees that it could by
no possibility have been otherwise than it is.</p>
<p id="b2c8a5">5. It may be said that, after all, Art does really
involve the knowledge which Science delivers;&mdash;that
the artisan who raises large weights, practically <em>knows</em>
the properties of the mechanical powers;&mdash;that he
who manufactures chemical compounds is virtually
acquainted with the laws of chemical combination.
To this we reply, that it might on the same grounds
be asserted, that he who acts upon the principle that
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third is
really acquainted with geometry; and that he who
balances himself on one foot knows the properties of
the center of gravity. But this is an acquaintance
with geometry and mechanics which even brute animals
possess. It is evident that it is not of such
knowledge as this that we have here to treat. It is
plain that this mode of possessing principles is
altogether different from that contemplation of them on
which science is founded. We neglect the most essential
and manifest differences, if we confound our unconscious
assumptions with our demonstrative reasonings.</p>
<p id="b2c8a6">6. The real state of the case is, that the principles
which Art <em>involves</em>, Science alone <em>evolves</em>. The truths
on which the success of Art depends, lurk in the
artist’s mind in an undeveloped state; guiding his
hand, stimulating his invention, balancing his judgment;
but not appearing in the form of enunciated
Propositions. Principles are not to him direct objects
of meditation: they are secret Powers of Nature, to
which the forms which tenant the world owe their
constancy, their movements, their changes, their luxuriant
and varied growth, but which he can nowhere
directly contemplate. That the creative and directive
Principles which have their lodgment in the artist’s
mind, when <em>unfolded</em> by our speculative powers into <span class="pagenum" id="page134">134</span>
systematic shape, become Science, is true; but it is
precisely this process of <em>development</em> which gives to
them their character of Science. In practical Art,
principles are unseen guides, leading us by invisible
strings through paths where the end alone is looked
at: it is for Science to direct and purge our vision so
that these airy ties, these principles and laws,
generalizations and theories, become distinct objects of vision.
Many may feel the intellectual monitor, but it is only
to her favourite heroes that the Goddess of Wisdom
visibly reveals herself.</p>
<p id="b2c8a7">7. Thus Art, in its earlier stages at least, is widely
different from Science, is independent of it, and is
anterior to it. At a later period, no doubt, Art may borrow
aid from Science; and the discoveries of the philosopher
may be of great value to the manufacturer and
the artist. But even then, this application forms no
essential part of the science: the interest which belongs
to it is not an intellectual interest. The augmentation
of human power and convenience may impel
or reward the physical philosopher; but the processes
by which man’s repasts are rendered more delicious,
his journeys more rapid, his weapons more terrible,
are not, therefore, Science. They may involve principles
which are of the highest interest to science; but
as the advantage is not practically more precious because
it results from a beautiful theory, so the theoretical
principle has no more conspicuous place in science
because it leads to convenient practical consequences.
The nature of Science is purely intellectual; Knowledge
alone,&mdash;exact general Truth,&mdash;is her object; and we
cannot mix with such material, as matters of the same
kind, the merely Empirical maxims of Art, without
introducing endless confusion into the subject, and
making it impossible to attain any solid footing in our
philosophy.</p>
<p class="end" id="b2c8a8">8. I shall therefore not place, in our Classification
of the Sciences, the Arts, as has generally been done;
nor shall I notice the applications of sciences to art,
as forming any separate portion of each science. The
sciences, considered as bodies of general speculative <span class="pagenum" id="page135">135</span>
truths, are what we are here concerned with; and
applications of such truths, whether useful or useless,
are important to us only as illustrations and examples.
Whatever place in human knowledge the Practical
Arts may hold, they are not Sciences. And it is only
by this rigorous separation of the Practical from the
Theoretical, that we can arrive at any solid conclusions
respecting the nature of Truth, and the mode of arriving
at it, such as it is our object to attain.</p>

Classification of Sciences has its chief use in
pointing out to us the extent of our powers of
arriving at truth, and the analogies which may obtain
between those certain and lucid portions of knowledge
with which we are here concerned, and those other
portions, of a very different interest and evidence,
which we here purposely abstain to touch upon. The
classification of human knowledge will, therefore, have
a more peculiar importance when we can include in it
the moral, political, and metaphysical, as well as the
physical portions of our knowledge. But such a survey
does not belong to our present undertaking: and
a general view of the connexion and order of the
branches of sciences which our review has hitherto included,
will even now possess some interest; and may
serve hereafter as an introduction to a more complete
scheme of the general body of human knowledge.</p>
<p id="b2c9a2">2. In this, as in any other case, a sound classification
must be the result, not of any assumed principles
imperatively applied to the subject, but of an examination
of the objects to be classified;&mdash;of an analysis of
them into the principles in which they agree and differ.
The Classification of Sciences must result from the
consideration of their nature and contents. Accordingly,
that review of the Sciences in which the <i>History</i> of
the Sciences engaged us, led to a Classification, of which
the main features are indicated in that work. The
Classification thus obtained, depends neither upon the
faculties of the mind to which the separate parts of
our knowledge owe their origin, nor upon the objects
which each science contemplates; but upon a more <span class="pagenum" id="page137">137</span>
natural and fundamental element;&mdash;namely, the <em>Ideas</em>
which each science involves. The Ideas regulate and
connect the facts, and are the foundations of the reasoning,
in each science: and having in another work
more fully examined these <i>Ideas</i>, we are now prepared
to state here the classification to which they lead. If
we have rightly traced each science to the Conceptions
which are really fundamental <em>with regard to it</em>, and
which give rise to the first principles on which it
depends, it is not necessary for our purpose that we
should decide whether these Conceptions are absolutely
ultimate principles of thought, or whether, on the contrary,
they can be further resolved into other Fundamental Ideas.
We need not now suppose it determined whether or not <i>Number</i>
is a mere modification
of the Idea of Time, and <i>Force</i> a mere modification of
the Idea of Cause: for however this may be, our Conception
of Number is the foundation of Arithmetic,
and our Conception of Force is the foundation of Mechanics.
It is to be observed also that in our classification,
each Science may involve, not only the Ideas
or Conceptions which are placed opposite to it in the
list, but also all which <em>precede</em> it. Thus Formal Astronomy
involves not only the Conception of Motion, but
also those which are the foundation of Arithmetic and
Geometry. In like manner. Physical Astronomy employs the
Sciences of Statics and Dynamics, and thus,
rests on their foundations; and they, in turn, depend
upon the Ideas of Space and of Time, as well as of
Cause.</p>
<p id="b2c9a3">3. We may further observe, that this arrangement
of Sciences according to the Fundamental Ideas which
they involve, points out the transition from those parts
of human knowledge which have been included in our
History and Philosophy, to other regions of speculation
into which we have not entered. We have repeatedly
found ourselves upon the borders of inquiries of a
psychological, or moral, or theological nature. Thus
the History of Physiology<a id="fnanchor28-2" href="#note28-2"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>
led us to the consideration <span class="pagenum" id="page138">138</span>
of Life, Sensation, and Volition; and at these Ideas we
stopped, that we might not transgress the boundaries of
our subject as then predetermined. It is plain that
the pursuit of such conceptions and their consequences,
would lead us to the sciences (if we are allowed to call
them sciences) which contemplate not only animal, but
human principles of action, to Anthropology, and Psychology.
In other ways, too, the Ideas which we hare
examined, although manifestly the foundations of sciences
such as we have here treated of also plainly
pointed to speculations of a different order; thus the
Idea of a Final Cause is an indispensable guide in
Biology, as we have seen; but the conception of Design
as directing the order of nature, once admitted, soon
carries us to higher contemplations. Again, the Class
of Palætiological Sciences which we were in the <i>History</i>
led to construct, although we there admitted only
one example of the Class, namely Geology, does in
reality include many vast lines of research; as the
history and causes of the division of plants and animals,
the history of languages, arts, and consequently
of civilization. Along with these researches, comes
the question how far these histories point backwards to
a natural or a supernatural origin; and the Idea of a
First Cause is thus brought under our consideration.
Finally, it is not difficult to see that as the Physical
Sciences have their peculiar governing Ideas, which
support and shape them, so the Moral and Political
Sciences also must similarly have their fundamental
and formative Ideas, the source of universal and certain
truths, each of their proper kind. But to follow
out the traces of this analogy, and to verify the
existence of those Fundamental Ideas in Morals and
Politics, is a task quite out of the sphere of the work
in which we are here engaged.</p>

<p id="b2c9a4">4. We may now place before the reader our Classification
of the Sciences. I have added to the list of
Sciences, a few not belonging to our present subject,
that the nature of the transition by which we are to
extend our philosophy into a wider and higher region
may be in some measure perceived. <span class="pagenum" id="page139">139</span></p>
<p>The Classification of the Sciences is given over leaf.</p>
<p>A few remarks upon it offer themselves.</p>
<p>The <i>Pure</i> Mathematical Sciences can hardly be called
<i>Inductive</i> Sciences. Their principles are not obtained
by Induction from Facts, but are necessarily assumed
in reasoning upon the subject matter which those
sciences involve.</p>
<p>The Astronomy of the Ancients aimed only at explaining
the motions of the heavenly bodies, as a <i>mechanism</i>.
Modern Astronomy, explains these motions on
the principles of Mechanics.</p>
<p>The term <i>Physics</i>, when confined to a peculiar
class of Sciences, is usually understood to exclude the
Mechanical Sciences on the one side, and Chemistry
on the other; and thus embraces the Secondary Mechanical
and Analytico-Mechanical Sciences. But the adjective
<i>Physical</i> applied to any science and opposed
to <i>Formal</i>, as in Astronomy and Optics, implies those
speculations in which we consider not only the Laws
of Phenomena but their Causes; and generally, as
in those cases, their Mechanical Causes.</p>
<p class="end">The term <i>Metaphysics</i> is applied to subjects in which
the Facts examined are emotions, thoughts and mental
conditions; subjects not included in our present survey. <span class="pagenum" id="page140">140</span></p>

<p><i>The Methods by which the construction of Science is promoted are,</i>
Methods of Observation, Methods of obtaining
clear Ideas, <i>and</i> Methods of Induction.</p>
<p class="noind" id="b3c1a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N the
preceding Book, we pointed out certain
general Characters of scientific knowledge which
may often serve to distinguish it from opinions of a
looser or vaguer kind. In the course of the progress
of knowledge from the earliest to the present time, men
have been led to a perception, more or less clear, of
these characteristics. Various philosophers, from Plato
and Aristotle in the ancient world, to Richard de Saint
Victor and Roger Bacon in the middle ages, Galileo
and Gilbert, Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton, in modern
times, were led to offer precepts and maxims, as fitted
to guide us to a real and fundamental knowledge of
nature. It may on another occasion be our business
to estimate the value of these precepts and maxims.
And other contributions of the same kind to the philosophy
of science might be noticed, and some which <span class="pagenum" id="page142">142</span>
contain still more valuable suggestions, and indicate a
more practical acquaintance with the subject. Among
these, I must especially distinguish Sir John Herschel’s
<i>Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</i>. But my
object at present is not to relate the history, but to
present the really valuable results of preceding labours: and
I shall endeavour to collect, both from them and from
my own researches and reflections, such views and
such rules as seem best adapted to assist us in the
discovery and recognition of scientific truth; or, at
least, such as may enable us to understand the process
by which this truth is obtained. I would present
to the reader the Philosophy and, if possible, the Art
of Discovery.</p>
<p id="b3c1a2">2. But, in truth, we must acknowledge, before we
proceed with this subject, that, speaking with strictness,
an <em>Art of Discovery</em> is not possible;&mdash;that we can
give no Rules for the pursuit of truth which shall be
universally and peremptorily applicable;&mdash;and that the
helps which we can offer to the inquirer in such cases
are limited and precarious. Still, we trust it will be
found that aids may be pointed out which are neither
worthless nor uninstructive. The mere classification
of examples of successful inquiry, to which our rules
give occasion, is full of interest for the philosophical
speculator. And if our maxims direct the discoverer
to no operations which might not have occurred to
his mind of themselves, they may still concentrate our
attention on that which is most important and characteristic
in these operations, and may direct us to
the best mode of insuring their success. I shall,
therefore, attempt to resolve the Process of Discovery
into its parts, and to give an account as distinct as
may be of Rules and Methods which belong to each
portion of the process.</p>
<p id="b3c1a3">3. In <a href="#page27">Book II.</a> we considered the three main
parts of the process by which science is constructed:
namely, the Decomposition and Observation of Complex Facts;
the Explication of our Ideal Conceptions; and the
Colligation of Elementary Facts by
means of those Conceptions. The first and last of <span class="pagenum" id="page143">143</span>
these three steps are capable of receiving additional
accuracy by peculiar processes. They may further the
advance of science in a more effectual manner, when
directed by special technical <i>Methods</i>, of which in the
present Book we must give a brief view. In this more
technical form, the observation of facts involves the
<i>Measurement of Phenomena</i>; and the Colligation of
Facts includes all arts and rules by which the process
of Induction can be assisted. Hence we shall have
here to consider <i>Methods of Observation</i>, and <i>Methods
of Induction</i>, using these phrases in the widest sense.
The second of the three steps above mentioned, the
Explication of our Conceptions, does not admit of being
much assisted by methods, although something may
be done by Education and Discussion.</p>
<p id="b3c1a4">4. The Methods of Induction, of which we have to
speak, apply only to the first step in our ascent from
phenomena to laws of nature;&mdash;the discovery of <i>Laws
of Phenomena</i>. A higher and ulterior step remains
behind, and follows in natural order the discovery of
Laws of Phenomena; namely, the <i>Discovery of Causes</i>;
and this must be stated as a distinct and essential process
in a complete view of the course of science. Again,
when we have thus ascended to the causes of phenomena and
of their laws, we can often reason downwards from the cause
so discovered; and we are thus
led to suggestions of new phenomena, or to new explanations
of phenomena already known. Such proceedings may be termed
<i>Applications</i> of our Discoveries;
including in the phrase, <i>Verifications</i> of our Doctrines
by such an application of them to observed facts.
Hence we have the following series of processes concerned
in the formation of science.<br />

<p id="b3c1a5">5. Of these six processes, the methods by which
the second and fourth may be assisted are here our <span class="pagenum" id="page144">144</span>
peculiar object of attention. The treatment of these
subjects in the present work must necessarily be scanty
and imperfect, although we may perhaps be able to add
something to what has hitherto been systematically
taught on these heads. Methods of Observation and
of Induction might of themselves form an abundant
subject for a treatise, and hereafter probably will do
so, in the hands of future writers. A few remarks,
offered as contributions to this subject, may serve to
show how extensive it is, and how much more ready
it now is than it ever before was, for a systematic discussion.</p>
<p class="end">Of the above steps of the formation of science, the
first, the Decomposition of Facts, has already been
sufficiently explained in the last Book: for if we
pursue it into further detail and exactitude, we find
that we gradually trench upon some of the succeeding
parts. I, therefore, proceed to treat of the second
step, the Measurement of Phenomena;&mdash;of <i>Methods</i>
by which this work, in its widest sense, is executed,
and these I shall term Methods of Observation.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>
SHALL speak, in this chapter, of Methods
of exact and systematic observation, by which
such facts are collected as form the materials of precise
scientific propositions. These Methods are very various,
according to the nature of the subject inquired
into, and other circumstances: but a great portion of
them agree in being processes of measurement. These
I shall peculiarly consider: and in the first place those
referring to Number, Space, and Time, which are at
the same time objects and instruments of measurement.</p>
<p id="b3c2a2">2. But though we have to explain how observations
may be made as perfect as possible, we must not
forget that in most cases complete perfection is
unattainable. <em>Observations are never perfect.</em>
For we <span class="pagenum" id="page146">146</span>
observe phenomena by our senses, and measure their
relations in time and space; but our senses and our
measures are all, from various causes, inaccurate. If
we have to observe the exact place of the moon among
the stars, how much of instrumental apparatus is
necessary! This apparatus has been improved by
many successive generations of astronomers, yet it is
still far from being perfect. And the senses of man,
as well as his implements, are limited in their exactness.
Two different observers do not obtain precisely
the same measures of the time and place of a phenomenon;
as, for instance, of the moment at which the
moon occults a star, and the point of her <i>limb</i> at which
the occultation takes place. Here, then, is a source of
inaccuracy and errour, even in astronomy, where the
means of exact observation are incomparably more
complete than they are in any other department of
human research. In other cases, the task of obtaining
accurate measures is far more difficult. If we have
to observe the tides of the ocean when rippled with
waves, we can see the average level of the water first
rise and then fall; but how hard is it to select the exact
moment when it is at its greatest height, or the exact
highest point which it reaches! It is very easy, in such
a case, to err by many minutes in time, and by several
inches in space.</p>
<p>Still, in many cases, good Methods can remove very
much of this inaccuracy, and to these we now proceed.</p>
<p id="b3c2a3">3. (I.) <i>Number</i>.&mdash;Number is the first step of
measurement, since it measures itself, and does not, like
space and time, require an arbitrary standard. Hence
the first exact observations, and the first advances of
rigorous knowledge, appear to have been made by means
of number; as for example,&mdash;the number of days in a
month and in a year;&mdash;the cycles according to which
eclipses occur;&mdash;the number of days in the revolutions
of the planets; and the like. All these discoveries, as
we have seen in the History of Astronomy, go back to
the earliest period of the science, anterior to any
distinct tradition; and these discoveries presuppose a series,
probably a very long series, of observations, made <span class="pagenum" id="page147">147</span>
principally by means of number. Nations so rude as to
have no other means of exact measurement, have still
systems of numeration by which they can reckon to a
considerable extent. Very often, such nations have very
complex systems, which are capable of expressing numbers
of great magnitude. Number supplies the means
of measuring other quantities, by the assumption of a
<em>unit</em> of measure of the appropriate kind: but where
nature supplies the unit, number is applicable directly
and immediately. Number is an important element in
the Classificatory as well as in the Mathematical Sciences.
The History of those Sciences shows how the
formation of botanical systems was effected by the
adoption of number as a leading element, by Cæsalpinus;
and how afterwards the Reform of Linnæus in classification
depended in a great degree on his finding, in the
pistils and stamens, a better numerical basis than those
before employed. In like manner, the number of rays
in the membrane of the gills<a id="fnanchor1-3" href="#note1-3"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>,
and the number of rays
in the fins of fish, were found to be important elements
in ichthyological classification by Artedi and Linnæus.
There are innumerable instances, in all parts of Natural
History, of the importance of the observation of number.
And in this observation, no instrument, scale or
standard is needed, or can be applied; except the
scale of natural numbers, expressed either in words or
in figures, can be considered as an instrument.</p>

</div>
<p id="b3c2a4">4. (II.) <i>Measurement of Space.</i>&mdash;Of quantities
admitting of <em>continuous</em> increase and decrease,
(for number is discontinuous,) space is the most simple in its
mode of measurement, and requires most frequently to
be measured. The obvious mode of measuring space is
by the repeated application of a material measure, as
when we take a foot-rule and measure the length of a
room. And in this case the foot-rule is the <em>unit</em> of
space, and the length of the room is expressed by the
number of such units which it contains: or, as it may
not contain an exact number, by a number with a
<i>fraction</i>. But besides this measurement of linear space, <span class="pagenum" id="page148">148</span>
there is another kind of space which, for purposes of
science, it is still more important to measure, namely,
angular space. The visible heavens being considered
as a sphere, the portions and paths of the heavenly
bodies are determined by drawing circles on the surface
of this sphere, and are expressed by means of the parts
of these circles thus intercepted: by such measures the
doctrines of astronomy were obtained in the very beginning
of the science. The arcs of circles thus measured,
are not like linear spaces, reckoned by means of an
<em>arbitrary</em> unit, for there is a <em>natural unit</em>, the total
circumference, to which all arcs may be referred. For
the sake of convenience, the whole circumference is
divided into 360 parts or <i>degrees</i>; and by means of
these degrees and their parts, all arcs are expressed.
The <em>arcs</em> are the measures of the <i>angles at the center</i>,
and the degrees may be considered indifferently as
measuring the one or the other of these quantities.</p>
<p id="b3c2a5">5. In the History of
Astronomy<a id="fnanchor2-3" href="#note2-3"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>,
I have described
the method of observation of celestial angles employed
by the Greeks. They determined the lines in which
the heavenly bodies were seen, by means either of
Shadows, or of Sights; and measured the angles between
such lines by arcs or rules properly applied to
them. The Armill, Astrolabe, Dioptra, and Parallactic
Instrument of the ancients, were some of the
instruments thus constructed. Tycho Brahe greatly
improved the methods of astronomical observation by
giving steadiness to the frame of his instruments,
(which were large <i>quadrants</i>,) and accuracy to the
divisions of the <i>limb</i><a id="fnanchor3-3" href="#note3-3"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>.
But the application of the
<i>telescope</i> to the astronomical quadrant and the fixation of
the center of the field by a <i>cross</i> of fine wires placed in
the focus, was an immense improvement of the instrument,
since it substituted a precise visual ray, pointing
to the star, instead of the coarse coincidence of Sights.
The accuracy of observation was still further increased <span class="pagenum" id="page149">149</span>
by applying to the telescope a <i>micrometer</i> which might
subdivide the smaller divisions of the arc.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-3" href="#fnanchor2-3">2</a></span>
<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i>  b. iii. c. iv. sect. 3.
</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-3" href="#fnanchor3-3">3</a></span>
<i>Ib.</i> b. vii. c. vi. sect. 1.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a6">6. By this means, the precision of astronomical observation
was made so great, that very minute angular
spaces could be measured: and it then became a question
whether discrepancies which appeared at first as
defects in the theory, might not arise sometimes from
a bending or shaking of the instrument, and from the
degrees marked on the limb being really somewhat
unequal, instead of being rigorously equal. Accordingly,
the framing and balancing of the instrument, so
as to avoid all possible tremor or flexure, and the exact
division of an arc into equal parts, became great objects
of those who wished to improve astronomical observations.
The observer no longer gazed at the stars from
a lofty tower, but placed his telescope on the solid
ground,&mdash;and braced and balanced it with various
contrivances. Instead of a quadrant, an entire circle was
introduced (by Ramsden;) and various processes were
invented for the dividing of instruments. Among
these we may notice Troughton’s method of dividing;
in which the visual ray of a microscope was substituted
for the points of a pair of compasses, and, by <i>stepping</i>
round the circle, the partial arcs were made to bear
their exact relation to the whole circumference.</p>
<p id="b3c2a7">7. Astronomy is not the only science which depends on
the measurement of angles. Crystallography
also requires exact measures of this kind; and the
<i>goniometer</i>, especially that devised by Wollaston,
supplies the means of obtaining such measures. The
science of Optics also, in many cases, requires the
measurement of angles.</p>
<p id="b3c2a8">8. In the measurement of linear space, there is no
natural standard which offers itself. Most of the common
measures appear to be taken from some part of
the human body; as a <i>foot</i>, a <i>cubit</i>, a <i>fathom</i>; but such
measures cannot possess any precision, and are altered
by convention: thus there were in ancient times many
kinds of cubits; and in modern Europe, there are a
great number of different standards of the foot, as the
Rhenish foot, the Paris foot, the English foot. It is <span class="pagenum" id="page150">150</span>
very desirable that, if possible, some permanent standard,
founded in nature, should be adopted; for the conventional
measures are lost in the course of ages; and
thus, dimensions expressed by means of them become
unintelligible. Two different natural standards have
been employed in modern times: the French have
referred their measures of length to the total
circumference of a meridian of the earth; a quadrant of this
meridian consists of ten million units or <i>metres</i>. The
English have fixed their linear measure by reference to
the length of a pendulum which employs an exact
second of time in its small oscillation. Both these
methods occasion considerable difficulties in carrying
them into effect; and are to be considered mainly as
means of recovering the standard if it should ever be
lost. For common purposes, some material standard is
adopted as authority for the time: for example, the
standard which in England possessed legal authority
up to the year 1835 was preserved in the House of
Parliament; and was lost in the conflagration which
destroyed that edifice. The standard of length now
generally referred to by men of science in England is
that which is in the possession of the Astronomical
Society of London.</p>
<p id="b3c2a9">9. A standard of length being established, the
artifices for applying it, and for subdividing it in the
most accurate manner, are nearly the same as in the
case of measures of arcs: as for instance, the employment
of the visual rays of microscopes instead of the
legs of compasses and the edges of rules; the use of
micrometers for minute measurements; and the like.
Many different modes of avoiding errour in such
measurements have been devised by various observers,
according to the nature of the cases with which they
had to deal<a id="fnanchor4-3" href="#note4-3"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note4-3" href="#fnanchor4-3">4</a></span> On the precautions employed in astronomical
instruments for the measure of space, see Sir J. Herschel’s
<i>Astronomy</i> (in the <i>Cabinet Cyclopædia</i>,) Arts. 103&ndash;110.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a10">10. (III.) <i>Measurement of Time</i>.&mdash;The methods of
measuring Time are not so obvious as the methods of <span class="pagenum" id="page151">151</span>
measuring space; for we cannot apply one portion of
time to another, so as to test their equality. We are
obliged to begin by assuming some change as the measure
of time. Thus the motion of the sun in the sky,
or the length and position of the shadows of objects,
were the first modes of measuring the parts of the day.
But what assurance had men, or what assurance could
they have, that the motion of the sun or of the shadow
was uniform? They could have no such assurance,
till they had adopted some measure of smaller times;
which smaller times, making up larger times by repetition,
they took as the standard of uniformity;&mdash;for
example, an hour-glass, or a clepsydra which answered
the same purpose among the ancients. There is no
apparent reason why the successive periods measured
by the emptying of the hour-glass should be unequal;
they are implicitly accepted as equal; and by reference
to these, the uniformity of the sun’s motion may be
verified. But the great improvement in the measurement
of time was the use of a pendulum for the purpose by
Galileo, and the application of this device to
clocks by Huyghens in 1656. For the successive
oscillations of a pendulum are rigorously equal, and a clock
is only a train of machinery employed for the purpose
of counting these oscillations. By means of this invention,
the measure of time in astronomical observations
became as accurate as the measure of space.</p>
<p id="b3c2a11">11. What is the <i>natural unit</i> of time? It was assumed
from the first by the Greek astronomers, that
the sidereal days, measured by the revolution of a star
from any meridian to the same meridian again, are
exactly equal; and all improvements in the measure of
time tended to confirm this assumption. The sidereal
day is therefore the natural standard of time. But the
solar day, determined by the diurnal revolution of the
sun, although not rigorously invariable, as the sidereal
day is, undergoes scarcely any perceptible variation;
and since the course of daily occurrences is regulated
by the sun, it is far more convenient to seek the basis
of our unit of time in <em>his</em> motions. Accordingly the
solar day (the <i>mean</i> solar day) is divided into 24 hours, <span class="pagenum" id="page152">152</span>
and these, into minutes and seconds; and this is our
scale of time. Of such time, the sidereal day has 23
hours 56 minutes 4·09 seconds. And it is plain that
by such a statement the length of the hour is fixed,
with reference to a sidereal day. The <i>standard</i> of
time (and the standard of space in like manner) equally
answers its purpose, whether or not it coincides with
any <i>whole number</i> of units.</p>
<p id="b3c2a12">12. Since the sidereal day is thus the standard of
our measures of time, it becomes desirable to refer to
it, constantly and exactly, the instruments by which
time is measured, in order that we may secure ourselves
against errour. For this purpose, in astronomical
observatories, observations are constantly made of the
transit of stars across the meridian; the <i>transit instrument</i>
with which this is done being adjusted with
all imaginable regard to
accuracy<a id="fnanchor5-3" href="#note5-3"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-3" href="#fnanchor5-3">5</a>
</span> On the precautions employed in the measure of
time by astronomers, see Herschel’s <i>Astronomy</i>, Art. 115&ndash;127.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a13">13. When exact measures of time are required in
other than astronomical observations, the same instruments
are still used, namely, clocks and chronometers.
In chronometers, the regulating part is an oscillating
body; not, as in clocks, a pendulum oscillating by the
force of gravity, but a wheel swinging to and fro on
its center, in consequence of the vibrations of a slender
coil of elastic wire. To divide time into still
smaller portions than these vibrations, other artifices
are used; some of which will be mentioned under the
next head.</p>
<p id="b3c2a14">14. (IV.) <i>Conversion of Space and Time.</i>&mdash;Space
and time agree in being extended quantities, which are
made up and measured by the repetition of homogeneous
parts. If a body move uniformly, whether in
the way of revolving or otherwise, the <em>space</em> which any
point describes, is <em>proportional</em> to the <em>time</em> of its
motion; and the space and the time may each be
taken as a measure of the other. Hence in such cases,
by taking space instead of time, or time instead of <span class="pagenum" id="page153">153</span>
space, we may often obtain more convenient and precise
measures, than we can by measuring directly the
element with which we are concerned.</p>
<p>The most prominent example of such a conversion,
is the measurement of the Right Ascension of stars,
(that is, their angular distance from a standard
meridian<a id="fnanchor6-3" href="#note6-3"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
on the celestial sphere,) by means of the time
employed in their coming to the meridian of the place
of observation. Since, as we have already stated, the
visible celestial sphere, carrying the fixed stars,
revolves with perfect uniformity about the pole; if we
observe the stars as they come in succession to a fixed
circle passing through the poles, the intervals of time
between these observations will be proportional to the
angles which the meridian circles passing through these
stars make at the poles where they meet; and hence,
if we have the means of measuring time with great
accuracy, we can, by watching the <em>times</em> of the transits
of successive stars across some visible mark in our own
meridian, determine the <em>angular distances</em> of the
meridian circles of all the stars from one another.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-3" href="#fnanchor6-3">6</a>
</span> A <i>meridian</i> is a circle passing through the
poles about which the celestial sphere revolves. The meridian
<em>of any place</em> on the earth is that  meridian which is
exactly over the place.
</div>
<p>Accordingly, now that the pendulum clock affords
astronomers the means of determining time exactly, a
measurement of the Right Ascensions of heavenly
bodies by means of a clock and a transit instrument,
is a part of the regular business of an observatory. If
the sidereal clock be so adjusted that it marks the
beginning of its scale of time when the first point of
Right Ascension is upon the visible meridian of our
observatory, the point of the scale at which the clock
points when any other star is in our meridian, will
truly represent the Right Ascension of the star.</p>
<p>Thus as the motion of the stars is our measure of
time, we employ time, conversely, as our measure of
the places of the stars. The celestial machine and our
terrestrial machines correspond to each other in their
movements; and the star steals silently and steadily <span class="pagenum" id="page154">154</span>
across our meridian line, just as the pointer of the
clock steals past the mark of the hour. We may judge
of the scale of this motion by considering that the full
moon employs about two minutes of time in sailing
across any fixed line seen against the sky, transverse
to her path: and all the celestial bodies, carried along
by the revolving sphere, travel at the same rate.</p>
<p id="b3c2a15">15. In this case, up to a certain degree, we render
our measures of astronomical angles more exact and
convenient by substituting time for space; but when,
in the very same kind of observation, we wish to proceed
to a greater degree of accuracy, we find that it
is best done by substituting space for time. In observing
the transit of a star across the meridian, if we
have the clock within hearing, we can count the beats
of the pendulum by the noise which they make, and
tell exactly at which second of time the passage of the
star across the visible thread takes place; and thus we
measure Right Ascension by means of time. But our
perception of time does not allow us to divide a second
into ten parts, and to pronounce whether the transit
takes place three-tenths, six-tenths, or seven-tenths of
a second after the preceding beat of the clock. This,
however, can be done by the usual mode of observing
the transit of a star. The observer, listening to the
beat of his clock, fastens his attention upon the star at
each beat, and especially at the one immediately before
and the one immediately after the passage of the
thread: and by this means he has these two positions
and the position of the thread so far present to his
intuition at once, that he can judge in what proportion
the thread is nearer to one position than the other, and
can thus divide the intervening second in its due proportion.
Thus if he observe that at the beginning of
the second the star is on one side of the thread, and at
the end of the second on the other side; and that the
two distances from the thread are as two to three, he
knows that the transit took place at two-fifths (or
four-tenths) of a second after the former beat. In this
way a second of time in astronomical observations
may, by a skilful observer, be divided into ten equal <span class="pagenum" id="page155">155</span>
parts; although when time is observed as time, a tenth
of a second appears almost to escape our senses. From
the above explanation, it will be seen that the reason
why the subdivision is possible in the way thus described,
is this:&mdash;that the moment of time thus to be
divided is so small, that the eye and the mind can
retain, to the end of this moment, the impression of
position which it received at the beginning. Though
the two positions of the star, and the intermediate
thread, are seen successively, they can be contemplated
by the mind as if they were seen simultaneously: and
thus it is precisely the smallness of this portion of
time which enables us to subdivide it by means of
space.</p>
<p id="b3c2a16">16. There is another case, of somewhat a different
kind, in which time is employed in measuring space;
namely, when space, or the standard of space, is defined
by the length of a pendulum oscillating in a given
time. We might in this way define any space by the
time which a pendulum of such a length would take
in oscillating; and thus we might speak, as was observed
by those who suggested this device, of five
minutes of cloth, or a rope half an hour long. We
may observe, however, that in this case, the space is
<em>not proportional</em> to the time. And we may add, that
though we thus appear to avoid the arbitrary standard of
space (for as we have seen, the standard of
measures of time is a natural one,) we do not do so in
fact: for we assume the invariableness of gravity,
which really varies (though very slightly,) from place
to place.</p>
<p id="b3c2a17">17. (V.) <i>The Method of Repetition in Measurement.</i>&mdash;In
many cases we can give great additional
accuracy to our measurements by repeatedly adding
to itself the quantity which we wish to measure. Thus
if we wished to ascertain the exact breadth of a thread,
it might not be easy to determine whether it was one-ninetieth,
or one-ninety-fifth, or one-hundredth part of
an inch; but if we find that ninety-six such threads
placed side by side occupy exactly an inch, we have
the precise measure of the breadth of the thread. In <span class="pagenum" id="page156">156</span>
the same manner, if two clocks are going nearly at the
same rate, we may not be able to distinguish the excess
of an oscillation of one of the pendulums over an
oscillation of the other: but when the two clocks have
gone for an hour, one of them may have gained ten
seconds upon the other; thus showing that the proportion
of their times of oscillation is 3610 to 3600.</p>
<p>In the latter of these instances, we have the principle
of repetition truly exemplified, because (as has been
justly observed by Sir J. Herschel<a id="fnanchor7-3" href="#note7-3"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>,)
there is then ‘a
juxtaposition of units without errour,’&mdash;‘one vibration
commences exactly where the last terminates, no part
of time being lost or gained in the addition of the
units so counted.’ In space, this juxtaposition of units
without errour cannot be rigorously accomplished,
since the units must be added together by material
contact (as in the above case of the threads,) or in
some equivalent manner. Yet the principle of repetition
has been applied to angular measurement with
considerable success in Borda’s Repeating Circle. In
this instrument, the angle between two objects which
we have to observe, is repeated along the graduated
limb of the circle by turning the telescope from one
object to the other, alternately fastened to the circle
(by its <i>clamp</i>) and loose from it (by unclamping). In
this manner the errours of graduation may (theoretically)
be entirely got rid of: for if an angle repeated
<i>nine</i> times be found to go twice round the circle, it
must be <em>exactly</em> eighty degrees: and where the repetition does
not give an exact number of circumferences,
it may still be made to subdivide the errour to any
required extent.</p>

</span> <i>Disc. Nat. Phil.</i> art. 121.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a18">18. Connected with the principle of repetition, is
the <i>Method of coincidences</i> or <i>interferences</i>. If we have
two Scales, on one of which an inch is divided into 10,
and on the other into 11 equal parts; and if, these
Scales being placed side by side, it appear that the
beginning of the latter Scale is between the 2nd and
3rd division of the former, it may not be apparent <span class="pagenum" id="page157">157</span>
what fraction added to 2 determines the place of beginning
of the second Scale as measured on the first. But
if it appear also that the 3rd division of the second
Scale <em>coincides</em> with a certain division of the first, (the
5th,) it is certain that 2 and <em>three-tenths</em> is the <em>exact</em>
place of the beginning of the second Scale, measured
on the first Scale. The 3rd division of the 11 Scale
will coincide (or interfere with) a division of the 10
Scale, when the beginning or <i>zero</i> of the 11 divisions
is three-tenths of a division beyond the preceding line
of the 10 Scale; as will be plain on a little consideration.
And if we have two Scales of equal units, in
which each unit is divided into nearly, but not quite,
the same number of equal parts (as 10 and 11, 19 and
20, 29 and 30,) and one sliding on the other, it will
always happen that some one or other of the division
lines will coincide, or very nearly coincide; and thus
the exact position of the beginning of one unit, measured
on the other scale, is determined. A sliding
scale, thus divided for the purpose of subdividing the
units of that on which it slides, is called a <i>Vernier</i>,
from the name of its inventor.</p>
<p id="b3c2a19">19. The same Principle of Coincidence or Interference
is applied to the exact measurement of the length
of time occupied in the oscillation of a pendulum. If
a detached pendulum, of such a length as to swing in
little less than a second, be placed before the seconds’
pendulum of a clock, and if the two pendulums begin
to move together, the former will gain upon the latter,
and in a little while their motions will be quite discordant.
But if we go on watching, we shall find
them, after a time, to agree again exactly; namely,
when the detached pendulum has gained one complete
oscillation (back and forwards,) upon the clock pendulum,
and again coincides with it in its motion. If this
happen after 5 minutes, we know that the times of
oscillation of the two pendulums are in the proportion
of 300 to 302, and therefore the detached pendulum
oscillates in <span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>150</sup>&frasl;<sub>151</sub></span>
of a second. The accuracy which can
be obtained in the measure of an oscillation by this
means is great; for the clock can be compared (by <span class="pagenum" id="page158">158</span>
observing transits of the stars or otherwise) with
the natural standard of time, the sidereal day. And
the moment of coincidence of the two pendulums
may, by proper arrangements, be very exactly determined.</p>
<p>We have hitherto spoken of methods of measuring
time and space, but other elements also may be very
precisely measured by various means.</p>
<p id="b3c2a20">20. (VI.) <i>Measurement of Weight.</i>&mdash;Weight, like
space and time, is a quantity made up by addition of
parts, and may be measured by similar methods. The
principle of repetition is applicable to the measurement
of weight; for if two bodies be simultaneously put in
the same pan of a balance, and if they balance pieces in
the other pan, their weights are exactly added.</p>
<p>There may be difficulties of practiced workmanship
in carrying into effect the mathematical conditions of
a perfect balance; for example, in securing an exact
equality of the effective arms of the beam in all positions.
These difficulties are evaded by the <i>Method of
double weighing</i>; according to which the standard
weights, and the body which is to be weighed, are
successively put in the <em>same</em> pan, and made to balance by
a third body in the opposite scale. By this means the
different lengths of the arms of the beam, and other
imperfections of the balance, become of no
consequence<a id="fnanchor8-3" href="#note8-3"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-3" href="#fnanchor8-3">8</a>
</span> For other methods of measuring weights accurately,
see Faraday’s <i>Chemical Manipulation</i>, p. 25.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a21">21. There is no natural <i>Standard</i> of weight. The
conventional weight taken as the standard, is the
weight of a given bulk of some known substance; for
instance, a <i>cubic foot of water</i>. But in order that this
may be definite, the water must not contain any portion
of heterogeneous substance: hence it is required
that the water be <em>distilled</em> water.</p>
<p id="b3c2a22">22. (VII.) <i>Measurement of Secondary Qualities.</i>&mdash;We
have already seen<a id="fnanchor9-3" href="#note9-3"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> that
secondary qualities are
estimated by means of conventional Scales, which refer <span class="pagenum" id="page159">159</span>
them to space, number, or some other definite expression.
Thus the Thermometer measures heat; the
Musical Scale, with or without the aid of number, expresses
the pitch of a note; and we may have an exact
and complete Scale of Colours, pure and impure. We
may remark, however, that with regard to sound and
colour, the estimates  of the ear and the eye are not
superseded, but only assisted: for if we determine
what a note is, by comparing it with an instrument
known to be in tune, we still leave the ear to decide
when the note is <em>in unison</em> with one of the notes of the
instrument. And when we compare a colour with our
chromatometer, we judge by the eye which division
of the chromatometer it <em>matches</em>. Colour and sound
have their Natural Scales, which the eye and ear
habitually apply; what science requires is, that those
scales should be systematized. We have seen that
several conditions are requisite in such scales of
qualities: the observer’s skill and ingenuity are mainly
shown in devising such scales and methods of applying
them.</p>

<a href="#page145">B. iii. c. ii.</a> Of the Measure of Secondary Qualities.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a23">23. The Method of Coincidences is employed in
harmonics: for if two notes are nearly, but not quite,
in unison, the coincidences of the vibrations produce
an audible undulation in the note, which is called the
<i>howl</i>; and the exactness of the unison is known by
this howl vanishing.</p>
<p id="b3c2a24">24. (VIII.) <i>Manipulation.</i>&mdash;The process of applying
practically methods of experiment and observation, is
termed Manipulation; and the value of observations
depends much upon the proficiency of the
observer in this art. This skill appears, as we have
said, not only in devising means and modes in measuring
results, but also in inventing and executing arrangements
by which elements are subjected to such
conditions as the investigation requires: in finding and
using some material combination by which nature shall
be asked the question which we have in our minds.
To do this in any subject may be considered as a
peculiar Art, but especially in Chemistry; where ‘many
experiments, and even whole trains of research, are <span class="pagenum" id="page160">160</span>
essentially dependent for success on mere
manipulation<a id="fnanchor10-3" href="#note10-3"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>.’
The changes which the chemist has to study,&mdash;compositions,
decompositions, and mutual actions,
affecting the internal structure rather than the external
form and motion of bodies,&mdash;are not familiarly
recognized by common observers, as those actions are
which operate upon the total mass of a body: and
hence it is only when the chemist has become, to a
certain degree, familiar with his science, that he has
the power of observing. He must learn to interpret
the effects of mixture, heat, and other Chemical agencies,
so as to see in them those facts which chemistry
makes the basis of her doctrines. And in learning to
interpret this language, he must also learn to call it
forth;&mdash;to place bodies under the requisite conditions,
by the apparatus of his own laboratory and the operations
of his own fingers. To do this with readiness
and precision, is, as we have said, an Art, both of the
mind and of the hand, in no small degree recondite
and difficult. A person may be well acquainted with
all the doctrines of chemistry, and may yet fail in the
simplest experiment. How many precautions and observances,
what resource and invention, what delicacy
and vigilance, are requisite in <i>Chemical Manipulation</i>,
may be seen by reference to Dr. Faraday’s work on
that subject.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-3" href="#fnanchor10-3">10</a></span>
Faraday’s <i>Chemical Manipulation</i>, p. 3.
</div>
<p id="b3c2a25">25. The same qualities in the observer are requisite
in some other departments of science; for example,
in the researches of Optics: for in these, after the first
broad facts have been noticed, the remaining features
of the phenomena are both very complex and very
minute; and require both ingenuity in the invention
of experiments, and a keen scrutiny of their results.
We have instances of the application of these qualities
in most of the optical experimenters of recent times,
and certainly in no one more than Sir David Brewster.
Omitting here all notice of his succeeding labours, his
<i>Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments</i>, published
in 1813, is an excellent model of the kind of resource <span class="pagenum" id="page161">161</span>
and skill of which we now speak. I may mention as
an example of this skill, his mode of determining the
refractive power of an <em>irregular</em> fragment of any
transparent substance. At first this might appear an
impossible problem; for it would seem that a regular and
smooth surface are requisite, in order that we may
have any measurable refraction. But Sir David Brewster
overcame the difficulty by immersing the fragment
in a combination of fluids, so mixed, that they had the
same refractive power as the specimen. The question,
<em>when</em> they had this power, was answered by noticing
when the fragment became so transparent that its surface
could hardly be seen; for this happened when, the
refractive power within and without the fragment being
the same, there was no refraction at the surface. And this
condition being obtained, the refractive power of the fluid,
and therefore of the fragment, was easily ascertained.</p>
<p id="b3c2a26">26. (IX.) <i>The Education of the Senses.</i>&mdash;Colour
and Musical Tone are, as we have seen, determined by
means of the Senses, whether or not Systematical Scales
are used in expressing the observed fact. Systematical
Scales of sensible qualities, however, not only give
precision to the record, but to the observation. But for
this purpose such an Education of the Senses is requisite
as may enable us to apply the scale immediately.
The memory must retain the sensation or perception
to which the technical term or degree of the scale
refers. Thus with regard to colour, as we have said
already<a id="fnanchor11-3" href="#note11-3"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>,
when we find such terms as <i>tin-white</i> or
<i>pinchbeck-brown</i>, the metallic colour so denoted ought
to occur at once to our recollection without delay or
search. The observer’s senses, therefore, must be educated,
at first by an actual exhibition of the standard,
and afterwards by a familiar use of it, to understand
readily and clearly each phrase and degree of the scales
which in his observations he has to apply. This is not
only the best, but in many cases the only way in which
the observation can be expressed. Thus <i>glassy lustre</i>,
<i>fatty lustre</i>, <i>adamantine lustre</i>, denote
certain kinds of <span class="pagenum" id="page162">162</span>
shining in minerals, which appearances we should
endeavour in vain to describe by periphrasis; and
which the terms, if considered as terms in common
language, would by no means clearly discriminate: for
who, in common language, would say that coal has a
fatty lustre? But these terms, in their conventional
sense, are perfectly definite; and when the eye is once
familiarized with this application of them, are easily
and clearly intelligible.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note11-3" href="#fnanchor11-3">11</a></span> B. viii. c. iii. Terminology.
[Please see Transcriber’s <a href="#tnote">Notes</a>.]
</div>
<p id="b3c2a27">27. The education of the senses, which is thus
requisite in order to understand well the terminology
of any science, must be acquired by an inspection of
the objects which the science deals with; and is, perhaps,
best promoted by the practical study of Natural
History. In the different departments of Natural
History, the descriptions of species are given by means
of an extensive technical <i>terminology</i>: and that education
of which we now speak, ought to produce the effect
of making the observer as familiar with each of the terms
of this terminology as we are with the words of our
common language. The technical terms have a much
more precise meaning than other terms, since they are
defined by express convention, and not learnt by common
usage merely. Yet though they are thus defined,
not the definition, but the perception itself, is that
which the term suggests to the proficient.</p>
<p>In order to use the terminology to any good purpose,
the student must possess it, not as a dictionary,
but as a language. The terminology of his sciences
must be the natural historian’s most familiar tongue.
He must learn to think in such language. And when
this is achieved, the terminology, as I have elsewhere
said, though to an uneducated eye cumbrous and
pedantical, is felt to be a useful implement, not an
oppressive burden<a id="fnanchor12-3" href="#note12-3"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>.
The impatient schoolboy looks upon
his grammar and vocabulary as irksome and burdensome;
but the accomplished student who has learnt
the language by means of them, knows that they have
given him the means of expressing what he thinks, and <span class="pagenum" id="page163">163</span>
even of thinking more precisely. And as the study of
language thus gives precision to the thoughts, the study
of Natural History, and especially of the descriptive
part of it, gives precision to the senses.</p>

</div>
<p>The Education of the Senses is also greatly promoted
by the practical pursuit of any science of experiment
and observation, as chemistry or astronomy.
The methods of manipulating, of which we have just
spoken, in chemistry, and the methods of measuring
extremely minute portions of space and time which are
employed in astronomy, and which are described in
the former part of this chapter, are among the best
modes of educating the senses for purposes of scientific
observation.</p>
<p class="end" id="b3c2a28">28. By the various Methods of precise observation
which we have thus very briefly described, facts are
collected, of an exact and definite kind; they are then
bound together in general laws, by the aid of general
ideas and of such methods as we have now to consider.
It is true, that the ideas which enable us to combine
facts into general propositions, do commonly operate in
our minds while we are still engaged in the office of
observing. Ideas of one kind or other are requisite to
connect our phenomena into facts, and to give meaning
to the terms of our descriptions: and it frequently
happens, that long before we have collected all the
facts which induction requires, the mind catches the
suggestion which some of these ideas offer, and leaps
forwards to a conjectural law while the labour of observation
is yet unfinished. But though this actually
occurs, it is easy to see that the process of combining
and generalizing facts is, in the order of nature, posterior
to, and distinct from, the process of observing
facts. Not only is this so, but there is an intermediate
step which, though inseparable from all successful
generalization, may be distinguished from it in our
survey; and may, in some degree, be assisted by peculiar
methods. To the consideration of such methods
we now proceed.</p>

susceptible of great precision.</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page165">165</span></p>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span>
ways in which men become masters of those
clear and yet comprehensive conceptions which
the formation and reception of science require, are
mainly two; which, although we cannot reduce them
to any exact scheme, we may still, in a loose use of
the term, call <i>Methods</i> of acquiring clear Ideas. These
two ways are Education and Discussion.</p>
<p id="b3c3a1">1. (I.) <i>Idea of Space.</i>&mdash;It is easily seen that
Education may do at least something to render our ideas
distinct and precise. To learn Geometry in youth,
tends, manifestly, to render our idea of space clear and
exact. By such an education, all the relations, and all
the consequences of this idea, come to be readily and
steadily apprehended; and thus it becomes easy for us
to understand portions of science which otherwise we
should by no means be able to comprehend. The conception
of <i>similar triangles</i> was to be mastered, before
the disciples of Thales could see the validity of his
method of determining the height of lofty objects by
the length of their shadows. The conception of <i>the
sphere with its circles</i> had to become familiar, before
the annual motion of the sun and its influence upon
the lengths of days could be rightly traced. The
properties of circles, combined with the
<i>pure</i><a id="fnanchor13-3" href="#note13-3"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>
<i>doctrine of
motion</i>, were required as an introduction to the theory
of Epicycles: the properties of <i>conic sections</i> were
needed, as a preparation for the discoveries of Kepler.
And not only was it necessary that men should possess
a <em>knowledge</em> of certain figures and their properties; but
it was equally necessary that they should have the
<em>habit of reasoning</em> with perfect steadiness, precision,
and conclusiveness concerning the relations of space.
No small discipline of the mind is requisite, in most
cases, to accustom it to go, with complete insight and
security, through the demonstrations respecting intersecting
planes and lines, dihedral and trihedral angles,
which occur in solid geometry. Yet how absolutely
necessary is a perfect mastery of such reasonings, to
him who is to explain the motions of the moon in <span class="pagenum" id="page166">166</span>
latitude and longitude! How necessary, again, is the
same faculty to the student of crystallography! Without
mathematical habits of conception and of thinking,
these portions of science are perfectly inaccessible. But
the early study of plane and solid geometry gives to
all tolerably gifted persons, the habits which are thus
needed. The discipline of following the reasonings of
didactic works on this subject, till we are quite familiar
with them, and of devising for ourselves reasonings of
the same kind, (as, for instance, the solutions of problems
proposed,) soon gives the mind the power of <em>discoursing</em>
with perfect facility concerning the most
complex and multiplied relations of space, and enables
us to refer to the properties of all plane and solid
figures as surely as to the visible forms of objects.
Thus we have here a signal instance of the efficacy of
education in giving to our Conceptions that clearness,
which the formation and existence of science indispensably require.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-3" href="#fnanchor13-3">13</a>
</span> See <i>Hist. Sc. Ideas</i>, b. ii. c. xiii.
</div>
<p id="b3c3a2">2. It is not my intention here to enter into the
details of the form which should be given to education,
in order that it may answer the purposes now contemplated.
But I may make a remark, which the above
examples naturally suggest, that in a mathematical
education, considered as a preparation for furthering
or understanding physical science, Geometry is to be
cultivated, far rather than Algebra:&mdash;the properties of
space are to be studied and reasoned upon as they are
in themselves, not as they are replaced and disguised
by symbolical representations. It is true, that when
the student is become quite familiar with elementary
geometry, he may often enable himself to deal in a
more rapid and comprehensive manner with the relations
of space, by using the language of symbols and
the principles of symbolical calculation: but this is an
ulterior step, which may be added to, but can never be
substituted for, the direct cultivation of geometry.
The method of symbolical reasoning employed upon
subjects of geometry and mechanics, has certainly
achieved some remarkable triumphs in the treatment
of the theory of the universe. These successful <span class="pagenum" id="page167">167</span>
applications of symbols in the highest problems of physical
astronomy appear to have made some teachers of mathematics
imagine that it is best to <em>begin</em> the pupil’s course
with such symbolical generalities. But this mode of
proceeding will be so far from giving the student clear
ideas of mathematical relations, that it will involve
him in utter confusion, and probably prevent his ever
obtaining a firm footing in geometry. To commence
mathematics in such a way, would be much as if we
should begin the study of a language by reading the
highest strains of its lyrical poetry.</p>
<p id="b3c3a3">3. (II.) <i>Idea of Number, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The study of
mathematics, as I need hardly observe, developes and renders
exact, our conceptions of the relations of number, as
well as of space. And although, as we have already
noticed, even in their original form the conceptions of
number are for the most part very distinct, they may
be still further improved by such discipline. In complex
cases, a methodical cultivation of the mind in such
subjects is needed: for instance, questions concerning
Cycles, and Intercalations, and Epacts, and the like,
require very great steadiness of arithmetical apprehension
in order that the reasoner may deal with them
rightly. In the same manner, a mastery of problems
belonging to the science of Pure Motion, or, as I have
termed it, <i>Mechanism</i>, requires either great natural
aptitude in the student, or a mind properly disciplined
by suitable branches of mathematical study.</p>
<p id="b3c3a4">4. Arithmetic and Geometry have long been standard
portions of the education of cultured persons throughout
the civilized world; and hence all such persons have
been able to accept and comprehend those portions of
science which depend upon the idea of space: for instance,
the doctrine of the globular form of the earth,
with its consequences, such as the measures of latitude
and longitude;&mdash;the heliocentric system of the universe
in modern, or the geocentric in ancient times;&mdash;the
explanation of the rainbow; and the like. In nations
where there is no such education, these portions of
science cannot exist as a part of the general stock of
the knowledge of society, however intelligently they <span class="pagenum" id="page168">168</span>
may be pursued by single philosophers dispersed here
and there in the community.</p>
<p id="b3c3a5">5. (III.) <i>Idea of Force.</i>&mdash;As the idea of Space is
brought out in its full evidence by the study of Geometry,
so the idea of Force is called up and developed
by the study of the science of Mechanics. It has
already been shown, in our scrutiny of the Ideas of the
Mechanical Sciences, that Force, the Cause of motion
or of equilibrium, involves an independent Fundamental
Idea, and is quite incapable of being resolved into any
mere modification of our conceptions of space, time,
and motion. And in order that the student may possess
this idea in a precise and manifest shape, he must
pursue the science of Mechanics in the mode which
this view of its nature demands;&mdash;that is, he must
study it as an independent science, resting on solid
elementary principles of its own, and not built upon
some other unmechanical science as its substructure.
He must trace the truths of Mechanics from their own
axioms and definitions; these axioms and definitions
being considered as merely means of bringing into
play the Idea on which the science depends. The conceptions
of force and matter, of action and reaction, of
momentum and inertia, with the reasonings in which
they are involved, cannot be evaded by any substitution
of lines or symbols for the conceptions. Any attempts
at such substitution would render the study of
Mechanics useless as a preparation of the mind for
physical science; and would, indeed, except counteracted
by great natural clearness of thought on such
subjects, fill the mind with confused and vague notions,
quite unavailing for any purposes of sound reasoning.
But, on the other hand, the study of Mechanics, in its
genuine form, as a branch of education, is fitted to give
a most useful and valuable precision of thought on
such subjects; and is the more to be recommended,
since, in the general habits of most men’s minds, the
mechanical conceptions are tainted with far greater
obscurity and perplexity than belongs to the conceptions
of number, space, and motion.</p>
<p id="b3c3a6">6. As habitually distinct conceptions of <i>space</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page169">169</span>
<i>motion</i> were requisite for the reception of the doctrines
of formal astronomy, (the Ptolemaic and Copernican
system,) so a clear and steady conception of <i>force</i>
is indispensably necessary for understanding the Newtonian
system of physical astronomy. It may be objected
that the study of Mechanics as a science has not
commonly formed part of a liberal education in Europe,
and yet that educated persons have commonly accepted
the Newtonian system. But to this we reply, that although
most persons of good intellectual culture have
professed to assent to the Newtonian system of the universe,
yet they have, in fact, entertained it in so vague
and perplexed a manner as to show very clearly that a
better mental preparation than the usual one is necessary,
in order that such persons may really understand
the doctrine of universal attraction. I have elsewhere
spoken of the prevalent indistinctness of mechanical
conceptions<a id="fnanchor14-3" href="#note14-3"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>;
and need not here dwell upon the
indications, constantly occurring in conversation and in
literature, of the utter inaccuracy of thought on such
subjects which may often be detected; for instance, in
the mode in which many men speak of centrifugal and
centripetal forces;&mdash;of projectile and central forces;&mdash;of
the effect of the moon upon the waters of the ocean;
and the like. The incoherence of ideas which we
frequently witness on such points, shows us clearly
that, in the minds of a great number of men, well
educated according to the present standard, the
acceptance of the doctrine of Universal Gravitation is a result
of traditional prejudice, not of rational conviction.
And those who are Newtonians on such grounds, are
not at all more intellectually advanced by being
Newtonians in the nineteenth century, than they would
have been by being Ptolemaics in the fifteenth.</p>

<p id="b3c3a7">7. It is undoubtedly in the highest degree desirable
that all great advances in science should become the
common property of all cultivated men. And this can
only be done by introducing into the course of a liberal
education such studies as unfold and fix in men’s minds <span class="pagenum" id="page170">170</span>
the fundamental ideas upon which the new-discovered
truths rest. The progress made by the ancients in
geography, astronomy, and other sciences, led them to
assign, wisely and well, a place to arithmetic and
geometry among the steps of an ingenuous education. The
discoveries of modern times have rendered these steps
still more indispensable; for we cannot consider a man
as cultivated up to the standard of his times, if he is
not only ignorant of, but incapable of comprehending,
the greatest achievements of the human intellect. And
as innumerable discoveries of all ages have thus secured
to Geometry her place as a part of good education, so
the great discoveries of Newton make it proper to introduce
Elementary Mechanics as a part of the same
course. If the education deserve to be called <i>good</i>,
the pupil will not remain ignorant of those discoveries,
the most remarkable extensions of the field of human
knowledge which have ever occurred. Yet he cannot
by possibility comprehend them, except his mind be
previously disciplined by mechanical studies. The period
appears now to be arrived when we may venture,
or rather when we are bound to endeavour, to include
a new class of Fundamental Ideas in the elementary
discipline of the human intellect. This is indispensable,
if we wish to educe the powers which we know
that it possesses, and to enrich it with the wealth which
lies within its reach<a id="fnanchor15-3" href="#note15-3"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-3" href="#fnanchor15-3">15</a>
</span> The University of Cambridge has, by a recent law,
made an examination in Elementary Mechanics requisite for the
Degree of B.A.
</div>
<p id="b3c3a8">8. By the view which is thus presented to us of the
nature and objects of intellectual education, we are led
to consider the mind of man as undergoing a progress
from age to age. By the discoveries which are made,
and by the clearness and evidence which, after a time,
(not suddenly nor soon,) the truths thus discovered acquire,
one portion of knowledge after another becomes
<em>elementary</em>; and if we would really secure this progress,
and make men share in it, these new portions
must be treated as elementary in the constitution of a <span class="pagenum" id="page171">171</span>
liberal education. Even in the rudest forms of intelligence,
man is immeasurably elevated above the unprogressive
brute, for the idea of number is so far developed that
he can count his flock or his arrows. But
when number is contemplated in a speculative form, he
has made a vast additional progress; when he steadily
apprehends the relations of space, he has again advanced;
when in thought he carries these relations into
the vault of the sky, into the expanse of the universe,
he reaches a higher intellectual position. And when
he carries into these wide regions, not only the relations
of space and time, but of cause and effect, of
force and reaction, he has again made an intellectual
advance; which, wide as it is at first, is accessible to
all; and with which all should acquaint themselves, if
they really desire to prosecute with energy the ascending
path of truth and knowledge which lies before
them. This should be an object of exertion to all ingenuous
and hopeful minds. For, that exertion is
necessary,&mdash;that after all possible facilities have been
afforded, it is still a matter of toil and struggle to
appropriate to ourselves the acquisitions of great discoverers,
is not to be denied. Elementary mechanics,
like elementary geometry, is a study accessible to all:
but like that too, or perhaps more than that, it is a
study which requires effort and contention of mind,&mdash;a
forced steadiness of thought. It is long since one complained
of this labour in geometry; and was answered
that in that region there is no <em>Royal Road</em>. The same
is true of Mechanics, and must be true of all branches
of solid education. But we should express the truth
more appropriately in our days by saying that there is
no <em>Popular Road</em> to these sciences. In the mind, as
in the body, strenuous exercise alone can give strength
and activity. The art of exact thought can be acquired
only by the labour of close thinking.</p>
<p id="b3c3a9">9. (IV.) <i>Chemical Ideas.</i>&mdash;We appear then to have
arrived at a point of human progress in which a liberal
education of the scientific intellect should include,
besides arithmetic, elementary geometry and mechanics. <span class="pagenum" id="page172">172</span>
The question then occurs to us, whether there are any other
Fundamental Ideas, among those belonging to
other sciences, which ought also to be made part of
such an education;&mdash;whether, for example, we should
strive to develope in the minds of all cultured men
the ideas of <i>polarity</i>, mechanical and chemical, of which
we spoke in a former part of this work.</p>
<p>The views to which we have been conducted by the
previous inquiry lead us to reply that it would not be
well at present to make <i>chemical</i> Polarities, at any
rate, a subject of elementary instruction. For even
the most profound and acute philosophers who have
speculated upon this subject,&mdash;they who are leading
the van in the march of discovery,&mdash;do not seem yet
to have reduced their thoughts on this subject to a
consistency, or to have taken hold of this idea of Polarity
in a manner quite satisfactory to their own
minds. This part of the subject is, therefore, by no
means ready to be introduced into a course of general
elementary education; for, with a view to such a purpose,
nothing less than the most thoroughly luminous
and transparent condition of the idea will suffice. Its
whole efficacy, as a means and object of disciplinal
study, depends upon there being no obscurity, perplexity,
or indefiniteness with regard to it, beyond that
transient deficiency which at first exists in the learner’s
mind, and is to be removed by his studies. The
idea of chemical Polarity is not yet in this condition;
and therefore is not yet fit for a place in education.
Yet since this idea of Polarity is the most general idea
which enters into chemistry, and appears to be that
which includes almost all the others, it would be
unphilosophical, and inconsistent with all sound views of
science, to introduce into education some chemical
conceptions, and to omit those which depend upon this
idea: indeed such a partial adoption of the science
could hardly take place without not only omitting, but
misrepresenting, a great part of our chemical knowledge.
The conclusion to which we are necessarily
led, therefore, is this:&mdash;that at present chemistry <span class="pagenum" id="page173">173</span>
cannot with any advantage, form a portion of the general
intellectual education<a id="fnanchor16-3" href="#note16-3"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-3" href="#fnanchor16-3">16</a>
</span> I do not here stop to prove that an education
(if it be so called) in which the memory only retains the
verbal expression of results, while the mind does not apprehend
the principles of the subject, and therefore cannot even
understand the words in which its doctrines are expressed,
is of no value whatever to the intellect, but rather, is highly
hurtful to the habits of thinking and reasoning.
</div>
<p id="b3c3a10">10. (V.) <i>Natural-History Ideas.</i>&mdash;But there remains
still another class of Ideas, with regard to
which we may very properly ask whether they may
not advantageously form a portion of a liberal education:
I mean the Ideas of definite Resemblance and
Difference, and of one set of resemblances subordinate
to another, which form the bases of the classificatory
sciences. These Ideas are developed by the study of
the various branches of Natural History, as Botany,
and Zoology; and beyond all doubt, those pursuits, if
assiduously followed, very materially affect the mental
habits. There is this obvious advantage to be looked
for from the study of Natural History, considered as
a means of intellectual discipline:&mdash;that it gives us, in
a precise and scientific form, examples of the classing
and naming of objects; which operations the use of
common language leads us constantly to perform in a
loose and inexact way. In the usual habits of our
minds and tongues, things are distinguished or brought
together, and names are applied, in a manner very indefinite,
vacillating, and seemingly capricious: and we
may naturally be led to doubt whether such defects
can be avoided;&mdash;whether exact distinctions of things,
and rigorous use of words be possible. Now upon this
point we may receive the instruction of Natural History;
which proves to us, by the actual performance of
the task, that a precise classification and nomenclature
are attainable, at least for a mass of objects all of the
same kind. Further, we also learn from this study,
that there may exist, not only an exact distinction of
kinds of things, but a series of distinctions, one set
subordinate to another, and the more general including <span class="pagenum" id="page174">174</span>
the more special, so as to form a system of classification.
All these are valuable lessons. If by the study
of Natural History we evolve, in a clear and well defined form,
the conceptions of <i>genus</i>, <i>species</i>, and of
<i>higher</i> and <i>lower steps</i> of classification,
we communicate precision, clearness, and method to the intellect,
through a great range of its operations.</p>
<p id="b3c3a11">11. It must be observed, that in order to attain the
disciplinal benefit which the study of Natural History
is fitted to bestow, we must teach the <em>natural</em> not the
artificial <i>classifications</i>; or at least the natural as well
as the artificial. For it is important for the student to
perceive that there are classifications, not merely arbitrary,
founded upon some <em>assumed</em> character, but natural, recognized
by some <em>discovered</em> character: he ought
to see that our classes being collected according to one
mark, are confirmed by many marks not originally stated
in our scheme; and are thus found to be grouped
together, not by a single resemblance, but by a mass of
resemblances, indicating a natural affinity. That objects
may be collected into such groups, is a highly important
lesson, which Natural History alone, pursued
as the science of <i>natural classes</i>, can teach.</p>
<p id="b3c3a12">12. Natural History has not unfrequently been
made a portion of education: and has in some degree
produced such effects as we have pointed out. It
would appear, however, that its lessons have, for the
most part, been very imperfectly learnt or understood
by persons of ordinary education: and that there are
perverse intellectual habits very commonly prevalent
in the cultivated classes, which ought ere now to have
been corrected by the general teaching of Natural
History. We may detect among speculative men
many prejudices respecting the nature and rules of
reasoning, which arise from pure mathematics having
been so long and so universally the instrument of
intellectual cultivation. Pure Mathematics reasons from
definitions: whatever term is introduced into her
pages, as a <i>circle</i>, or a <i>square</i>, its definition comes along
with it: and this definition is supposed to supply all
that the reasoner needs to know, respecting the term. <span class="pagenum" id="page175">175</span>
If there be any doubt concerning the validity of the
conclusion, the doubt is resolved by recurring to the
definitions. Hence it has come to pass that in other
subjects also, men seek for and demand definitions as
the most secure foundation of reasoning. The definition
and the term defined are conceived to be so far
identical, that in all cases the one may be substituted
for the other; and such a substitution is held to be
the best mode of detecting fallacies.</p>
<p id="b3c3a13">13. It has already been shown that even geometry
is not founded upon definitions alone: and we shall
not here again analyse the fallacy of this belief in the
supreme value of definitions. But we may remark
that the study of Natural History appears to be the
proper remedy for this erroneous habit of thought. For
in every department of Natural History the object of
our study is <em>kinds</em> of things, not one of which kinds
can be rigorously defined, yet all of them are sufficiently
definite. In these cases we may indeed give a
specific description of one of the kinds, and may call it
a definition; but it is clear that such a definition does
not contain the essence of the thing. We
say<a id="fnanchor17-3" href="#note17-3"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> that the
Rose Tribe are ‘Polypetalous dicotyledons, with lateral
styles, superior simple ovaria, regular perigynous stamens,
exalbuminous definite seeds, and alternate stipulate leaves.’
But no one would say that this was our
essential conception of a rose, to be substituted for it
in all cases of doubt or obscurity, by way of making
our reasonings perfectly clear. Not only so; but as
we have already seen<a id="fnanchor18-3" href="#note18-3"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>,
the definition does not even
apply to all the tribe. For the stipulæ are absent in
Lowea: the albumen is present in Neillia: the fruit of
Spiræa sorbifolia is capsular. If, then, we can possess
any certain knowledge in Natural History, (which no
cultivator of the subject will doubt,) it is evident that
our knowledge cannot depend on the possibility of laying
down exact definitions and reasoning from them.</p>

</span> <i>Hist. Sc. Ideas,</i> b. viii. c. ii. sect. 3.
</div>
<p id="b3c3a14">14. But it may be asked, if we cannot define a <span class="pagenum" id="page176">176</span>
word, or a class of things which a word denotes, how
can we distinguish what it does mean from what it
does not mean? How can we say that it signifies one
thing rather than another, except we declare what is
its signification?</p>
<p>The answer to this question involves the general
principle of a natural method of classification, which
has already been stated<a id="fnanchor19-3" href="#note19-3"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>
and need not here be again
dwelt on. It has been shown that names of <em>kinds</em> of
things (<i>genera</i>) associate them according to total
resemblances, not partial characters. The principle
which connects a group of objects in natural history is
not a <em>definition</em>, but a <em>type</em>. Thus we take as the type
of the Rose family, it may be, the common <i>wild rose</i>;
all species which resemble this flower more than they
resemble any other group of species are also <i>roses</i>, and
form one <i>genus</i>. All genera which resemble Roses
more than they resemble any other group of genera
are of the same <i>family</i>. And thus the Rose family
is collected about some one species, which is the type
or central point of the group.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-3" href="#fnanchor19-3">19</a>
</span> <i>Hist. Sc. Ideas,</i> b. viii. c. ii. sect. 3.
</div>
<p>In such an arrangement, it may readily be conceived
that though the nucleus of each group may cohere
firmly together, the outskirts of contiguous groups
may approach, and may even be intermingled, so that
some species may doubtfully adhere to one group or
another. Yet this uncertainty does not at all affect
the truths which we find ourselves enabled to assert
with regard to the general mass of each group. And
thus we are taught that there may be very important
differences between two groups of objects, although we
are unable to tell where the one group ends and where
the other begins; and that there may be propositions
of indisputable truth, in which it is impossible to give
unexceptionable definitions of the terms employed.</p>
<p id="b3c3a15">15. These lessons are of the highest value with
regard to all employments of the human mind; for the
mode in which words in common use acquire their
meaning, approaches far more nearly to the <i>Method of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="page177">177</span> <i>Type</i> than
to the method of definition. The terms
which belong to our practical concerns, or to our spontaneous
and unscientific speculations, are rarely capable
of exact definition. They have been devised in order
to express assertions, often very important, yet very
vaguely conceived: and the signification of the word is
extended, as far as the assertion conveyed by it can be
extended, by apparent connexion or by analogy. And
thus, in all the attempts of man to grasp at knowledge,
we have an exemplification of that which we have
stated as the rule of induction, that Definition and
Proposition are mutually dependent, each adjusted so
as to give value and meaning to the other: and this is
so, even when both the elements of truth are defective
in precision: the Definition being replaced by an
incomplete description or a loose reference to a Type;
and the Proposition being in a corresponding degree
insecure.</p>
<p id="b3c3a16">16. Thus the study of Natural History, as a corrective
of the belief that definitions are essential to
substantial truth, might be of great use; and the advantage
which might thus be obtained is such as well
entitles this study to a place in a liberal education.
We may further observe, that in order that Natural
History may produce such an effect, it must be studied
by inspection of the <em>objects</em> themselves, and not by the
reading of books only. Its lesson is, that we must in
all cases of doubt or obscurity refer, not to words or
definitions, but to things. The Book of Nature is its
dictionary: it is there that the natural historian looks,
to find the meaning of the words which he
uses<a id="fnanchor20-3" href="#note20-3"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>. So
<span class="pagenum" id="page178">178</span> long as a plant,
in its most essential parts, is more <em>like</em>
a rose than any thing else, it <em>is</em> a rose. He knows no
other definition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-3" href="#fnanchor20-3">20</a>
</span> It is a curious example of the influence of the belief
in definitions, that elementary books have been written in which
Natural History is taught in the way of question and answer, and
consequently by means of words alone. In such a scheme, of course
all objects are <em>defined</em>: and we may easily anticipate
the value of the knowledge thus conveyed. Thus, ‘Iron is a
well-known hard metal, of a darkish gray colour, and very elastic:’
‘Copper is an orange-coloured  metal, more sonorous than any other,
and the most elastic of any except iron.’ This is to pervert
the meaning of education, and to make it a business of mere words.
</div>
<p id="b3c3a17">17. (VI.) <i>Well-established Ideas alone to be used.</i>&mdash;We
may assert in general what we have elsewhere, as
above, stated specially with reference to the fundamental
principles of chemistry:&mdash;no Ideas are suited to become
the elements of elementary education, till they have not
only become perfectly distinct and fixed in the minds
of the leading cultivators of the science to which they
belong; but till they have been so for some considerable
period. The entire clearness and steadiness of view
which is essential to sound science, must have time to
extend itself to a wide circle of disciples. The views
and principles which are detected by the most profound
and acute philosophers, are soon appropriated by all the
most intelligent and active minds of their own and of
the following generations; and when this has taken
place, (and not till then,) it is right, by a proper
constitution of our liberal education, to extend a general
knowledge of such principles to all cultivated persons.
And it follows, from this view of the matter, that we
are by no means to be in haste to adopt, into our
course of education, all new discoveries as soon as they
are made. They require some time, in order to settle
into their proper place and position in men’s minds,
and to show themselves under their true aspects; and
till this is done, we confuse and disturb, rather than
enlighten and unfold, the ideas of learners, by introducing
the discoveries into our elementary instruction.
Hence it was perhaps reasonable that a century should
elapse from the time of Galileo, before the rigorous
teaching of Mechanics became a general element of
intellectual training; and the doctrine of Universal
Gravitation was hardly ripe for such an employment till
the end of the last century. We must not direct the
unformed youthful mind to launch its little bark upon
the waters of speculation, till all the agitation of
discovery, with its consequent fluctuation and
controversy, has well subsided.</p>
<p id="b3c3a18">18. But it may be asked, How is it
that time <span class="pagenum" id="page179">179</span> operates
to give distinctness and evidence to scientific
ideas? In what way does it happen that views and
principles, obscure and wavering at first, after a while
become luminous and steady? Can we point out any
process, any intermediate steps, by which this result is
produced? If we can, this process must be an important
portion of the subject now under our consideration.</p>
<p class="end">To this we reply, that the transition from the hesitation
and contradiction with which true ideas are first
received, to the general assent and clear apprehension
which they afterwards obtain, takes place through
the circulation of various arguments for and against
them, and various modes of presenting and testing
them, all which we may include under the term <i>Discussion</i>,
which we have already mentioned as the
second of the two ways by which scientific views are
developed into full maturity.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b3c4a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>T
is easily seen that in every part of science, the
establishment of a new set of ideas has been accompanied
with much of doubt and dissent. And by
means of discussions so occasioned, the new conceptions,
and the opinions which involve them, have gradually become
definite and clear. The authors and
asserters of the new opinions, in order to make them
defensible, have been compelled to make them consistent:
in order to recommend them to others, they have
been obliged to make them more entirely intelligible
to themselves. And thus the Terms which formed the
main points of the controversy, although applied in a
loose and vacillating manner at first, have in the end
become perfectly definite and exact. The opinions discussed
have been, in their main features, the same
throughout the debate; but they have at first been
dimly, and at last clearly apprehended: like the objects
of a landscape, at which we look through a telescope
ill adjusted, till, by sliding the tube backwards and <span class="pagenum" id="page181">181</span>
forwards, we at last bring it into focus, and perceive
every feature of the prospect sharp and bright.</p>
<p id="b3c4a2">2. We have in the last
Book<a id="fnanchor21-3" href="#note21-3"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> fully exemplified
this gradual progress of conceptions from obscurity
to clearness by means of Discussion. We have
seen, too, that this mode of treating the subject has
never been successful, except when it has been associated
with an appeal to facts as well as to reasonings.
A combination of experiment with argument, of observation
with demonstration, has always been found
requisite in order that men should arrive at those
distinct conceptions which give them substantial truths.
The arguments used led to the rejection of undefined,
ambiguous, self-contradictory notions; but the reference
to facts led to the selection, or at least to the
retention, of the conceptions which were both true and
useful. The two correlative processes, definition and
true assertion, the formation of clear ideas and the
induction of laws, went on together.</p>

Of the Explication of Conceptions.
</div>
<p>Thus those discussions by which scientific conceptions
are rendered ultimately quite distinct and fixed,
include both reasonings from Principles and illustrations
from Facts. At present we turn our attention
more peculiarly to the former part of the process;
according to the distinction already drawn, between the
Explication of Conceptions and the Colligation of Facts.
The Discussions of which we here speak, are the Method
(if they may be called a <i>method</i>) by which the
Explication of Conceptions is carried to the requisite
point among philosophers.</p>
<p id="b3c4a3">3. In the <i>History</i> of the Fundamental Ideas of the
Sciences which forms the Prelude to this work, and
in the <i>History of the Inductive Sciences</i>, I have, in
several instances, traced the steps by which, historically
speaking, these Ideas have obtained their ultimate and
permanent place in the minds of speculative
men. I have thus exemplified the reasonings and controversies
which constitute such Discussion as we now
speak of. I have stated, at considerable length, the <span class="pagenum" id="page182">182</span>
various attempts, failures, and advances, by which the
ideas which enter into the science of Mechanics were
evolved into their present evidence. In like manner
we have seen the conception of <i>refracted rays</i> of light,
obscure and confused in Seneca, growing clearer in
Roger Bacon, more definite in Descartes, perfectly
distinct in Newton. The <i>polarity</i> of light, at first
contemplated with some perplexity, became very distinct
to Malus, Young, and Fresnel; yet the phenomena of
<i>circular polarization</i>, and still more, the <i>circular
polarization of fluids</i>, leave us, even at present, some
difficulty in fully mastering this conception. The <i>related
polarities</i> of electricity and magnetism are not yet
fully comprehended, even by our greatest philosophers.
One of Mr. Faraday’s late papers (the Fourteenth Series of his
Researches) is employed in an experimental
discussion of this subject, which leads to no satisfactory
result. The controversy between MM. Biot and
Ampère<a id="fnanchor22-3" href="#note22-3"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>,
on the nature of the Elementary Forces in electro-dynamic
action, is another evidence that the discussion of this
subject has not yet reached its termination.
With regard to <i>chemical polarity</i>, I have already stated
that this idea is as yet very far from being brought to
an ultimate condition of definiteness; and the subject
of Chemical Forces, (for that whole subject must be included
in this idea of polarity,) which has already occasioned much
perplexity and controversy, may easily
occasion much more, before it is settled to the satisfaction
of the philosophical world. The ideas of the
<i>classificatory</i> sciences also have of late been undergoing
much, and very instructive discussion, in the controversies
respecting the relations and offices of the natural
and artificial methods. And with regard to <i>physiological</i>
ideas, it would hardly be too much to say,
that the whole history of physiology up to the present
time has consisted of the discussion of the fundamental
ideas of the science, such as Vital Forces, Nutrition,
Reproduction, and the like. We had before us at
some length, in the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>, a review
<span class="pagenum" id="page183">183</span> of
the opposite opinions which have been advanced
on this subject; and we attempted in some degree to
estimate the direction in which these ideas are permanently
settling. But without attaching any importance
to this attempt, the account there given may at least
serve to show, how important a share in the past progress
of this subject the <i>discussion</i> of its Fundamental
Ideas has hitherto had.</p>

<p id="b3c4a4">4. There is one reflexion which is very pointedly
suggested by what has been said. The manner in
which our scientific ideas acquire their distinct and
ultimate form being such as has been described,&mdash;always
involving much abstract reasoning and analysis
of our conceptions, often much opposite argumentation
and debate;&mdash;how unphilosophical is it to speak of
abstraction and analysis, of dispute and controversy, as
frivolous and unprofitable processes, by which true
science can never be benefitted; and how erroneous
to put such employments in antithesis with the study
of facts!</p>
<p>Yet some writers are accustomed to talk with contempt
of all past controversies, and to wonder at the
blindness of those who did not <em>at first</em> take the view
which was established <em>at last</em>. Such persons forget
that it was precisely the controversy, which established
among speculative men that final doctrine which they
themselves have quietly accepted. It is true, they
have had no difficulty in thoroughly adopting the
truth; but that has occurred because all dissentient
doctrines have been suppressed and forgotten; and because
systems, and books, and language itself, have
been accommodated peculiarly to the expression of
the accepted truth. To despise those who have, by
their mental struggles and conflicts, brought the subject
into a condition in which errour is almost out of
our reach, is to be ungrateful exactly in proportion to
the amount of the benefit received. It is as if a child,
when its teacher had with many trials and much
trouble prepared a telescope so that the vision through
it was distinct, should wonder at his stupidity in
pushing the tube of the eye-glass out and in so often. <span class="pagenum" id="page184">184</span></p>
<p id="b3c4a5">5. Again, some persons condemn all that we have
here spoken of as the discussion of ideas, terming it
<i>metaphysical</i>: and in this spirit, one
writer<a id="fnanchor23-3" href="#note23-3"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> has
spoken of the ‘metaphysical period’ of each science,
as preceding the period of ‘positive knowledge.’ But
as we have seen, that process which is here termed
‘metaphysical,’&mdash;the analysis of our conceptions and
the exposure of their inconsistencies,&mdash;(accompanied
with the study of facts,)&mdash;has always gone on most
actively in the most prosperous periods of each science.
There is, in Galileo, Kepler, Gassendi, and the other
fathers of mechanical philosophy, as much of <em>metaphysics</em>
as in their adversaries. The main difference
is, that the metaphysics is of a better kind; it is more
conformable to metaphysical truth. And the same is
the case in other sciences. Nor can it be otherwise.
For all truth, before it can be consistent with <em>facts</em>,
must be consistent with <em>itself</em>: and although this rule
is of undeniable authority, its application is often far
from easy. The perplexities and ambiguities which
arise from our having the same idea presented to us
under different aspects, are often difficult to
disentangle: and no common acuteness and steadiness of
thought must be expended on the task. It would be
easy to adduce, from the works of all great discoverers,
passages more profoundly metaphysical than any which
are to be found in the pages of barren <i>à priori</i> reasoners.</p>

</span> M. Auguste Comte, <i>Cours de Philosophie Positive</i>.
</div>
<p id="b3c4a6">6. As we have said, these metaphysical discussions
are not to be put in opposition to the study of facts;
but are to be stimulated, nourished and directed by a
constant recourse to experiment and observation. The
cultivation of ideas is to be conducted as having for
its object the connexion of facts; never to be pursued
as a mere exercise of the subtilty of the mind, striving
to build up a world of its own, and neglecting that
which exists about us. For although man may in this
way please himself, and admire the creations of his
own brain, he can never, by this course, hit upon the <span class="pagenum" id="page185">185</span>
real scheme of nature. With his ideas unfolded by
education, sharpened by controversy, rectified by metaphysics,
he may <em>understand</em> the natural world, but he
cannot <em>invent</em> it. At every step, he must try the value
of the advances he has made in thought, by applying
his thoughts to things. The Explication of Conceptions
must be carried on with a perpetual reference to
the Colligation of Facts.</p>
<p class="end">Having here treated of Education and Discussion as
the methods by which the former of these two processes
is to be promoted, we have now to explain the
methods which science employs in order most successfully
to execute the latter. But the Colligation of
Facts, as already stated, may offer to us two steps of
a very different kind,&mdash;the laws of Phenomena, and
their Causes. We shall first describe some of the
methods employed in obtaining truths of the former of
these two kinds.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXXV.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b3c5a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>HEN
facts have been decomposed and phenomena measured,
the philosopher endeavours to combine them into general laws,
by the aid of <span class="pagenum" id="page187">187</span> Ideas and Conceptions; these being
illustrated and regulated by such means as we have spoken of in the last
two chapters. In this task, of gathering laws of nature
from observed facts, as we have already
said<a id="fnanchor24-3" href="#note24-3"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>, the natural
sagacity of gifted minds is the power by which
the greater part of the successful results have been
obtained; and this power will probably always be more
efficacious than any Method can be. Still there are
certain methods of procedure which may, in such investigations,
give us no inconsiderable aid, and these I
shall endeavour to expound.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note24-3" href="#fnanchor24-3">24</a></span> <a href="#page97">B. ii. c. vi.</a>
</div>
<p id="b3c5a2">2. For this purpose, I remark that the Colligation
of ascertained Facts into general Propositions may be
considered as containing three steps, which I shall
term the <i>Selection of the Idea</i>, <i>the Construction of the
Conception</i>, and <i>the Determination of the Magnitudes</i>.
It will be recollected that by the word <i>Idea</i>,
(or Fundamental Idea,) used in a peculiar sense, I mean certain
wide and general fields of intelligible relation, such as
Space, Number, Cause, Likeness; while by <i>Conception</i>
I denote more special modifications of these ideas, as a
<i>circle</i>, a <i>square number</i>, a <i>uniform force</i>, a <i>like form</i> of
flower. Now in order to establish any law by reference
to facts, we must select the <i>true Idea</i> and the <i>true
Conception</i>. For example; when Hipparchus
found<a id="fnanchor25-3" href="#note25-3"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>
that the distance of the bright star Spica Virginis from
the equinoxial point had increased by two degrees in
about two hundred years, and desired to reduce this
change to a law, he had first to assign, if possible, the
<em>idea</em> on which it depended;&mdash;whether it was regulated
for instance, by <em>space</em>, or by <em>time</em>; whether it was determined
by the positions of other stars at each moment, or went on
progressively with the lapse of ages.
And when there was found reason to select <em>time</em> as the
regulative <em>idea</em> of this change, it was then to be determined
how the change went on with the time;&mdash;whether uniformly,
or in some other manner: the <em>conception</em>, or the rule
of the progression, was to be <span class="pagenum" id="page188">188</span> rightly constructed.
Finally, it being ascertained that
the change did go on uniformly, the question then
occurred what was its <em>amount</em>:&mdash;whether exactly a
degree in a century, or more, or less, and how much:
and thus the determination of the <em>magnitude</em> completed
the discovery of the law of phenomena respecting this star.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note25-3" href="#fnanchor25-3">25</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. iii. c. iv. sect. 3.
</div>
<p id="b3c5a3">3. Steps similar to these three may be discerned
in all other discoveries of laws of nature. Thus, in
investigating the laws of the motions of the sun, moon
or planets, we find that these motions may be resolved,
besides a uniform motion, into a series of partial motions,
or Inequalities; and for each of these Inequalities,
we have to learn upon what it directly depends, whether
upon the progress of time only, or upon some configuration
of the heavenly bodies in space; then, we have
to ascertain its law; and finally, we have to determine
what is its amount. In the case of such Inequalities,
the fundamental element on which the Inequality depends,
is called by mathematicians the <i>Argument</i>. And
when the Inequality has been fully reduced to known
rules, and expressed in the form of a Table, the Argument
is the fundamental Series of Numbers which
stands in the margin of the Table, and by means of
which we refer to the other Numbers which express
the Inequality. Thus, in order to obtain from a Solar
Table the Inequality of the sun’s annual motion, the
Argument is the Number which expresses the day of
the year; the Inequalities for each day being (in the
Table) ranged in a line corresponding to the days.
Moreover, the Argument of an Inequality being assumed
to be known, we must, in order to calculate the
Table, that is, in order to exhibit the law of nature,
know also the <em>Law</em> of the Inequality, and its <em>Amount</em>.
And the investigation of these three things, the Argument,
the Law, and the Amount of the Inequality,
represents the three steps above described, the
Selection of the Idea, the Construction of the Conception,
and the Determination of the Magnitude.</p>
<p id="b3c5a4">4. In a great body of cases, <i>mathematical</i> language
and calculation are used to express the
connexion <span class="pagenum" id="page189">189</span> between
the general law and the special facts. And when
this is done, the three steps above described may be
spoken of as the Selection of the <i>Independent Variable</i>,
the Construction of the <i>Formula</i>, and the Determination
of the <i>Coefficients</i>. It may be worth our while to
attend to an exemplification of this. Suppose then,
that, in such observations as we have just spoken of,
namely, the shifting of a star from its place in the
heavens by an unknown law, astronomers had, at the
end of three successive years, found that the star had
removed by 3, by 8, and by 15 minutes from its original place.
Suppose it to be ascertained also, by
methods of which we shall hereafter treat, that this
change depends upon the time; we must then take the
<em>time</em>, (which we may denote by the symbol <i>t</i>,) for the
<em>independent variable</em>. But though the star changes
its place <em>with</em> the time, the change is not <em>proportional</em>
to the time; for its motion which is only 3 minutes in
the first year, is 5 minutes in the second year, and 7
in the third. But it is not difficult for a person a little
versed in mathematics to perceive that the series 3, 8,
15, may be obtained by means of two terms, one of
which is proportional to the time, and the other to the
square of the time; that is, it is expressed by the <i>formula at + btt</i>.
The question then occurs, what are the
values of the <em>coefficients</em> <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>;
and a little examination of the case shows us that <i>a</i> must be 2,
and <i>b</i>, 1: so that the formula is 2<i>t</i> + <i>tt</i>.
Indeed if we add together the series 2, 4, 6, which expresses a change
proportional to the time, and 1, 4, 9, which is proportional
to the square of the time, we obtain the series
3, 8, 15, which is the series of numbers given by observation.
And thus the three steps which give us the
Idea, the Conception, and the Magnitudes; or the
Argument, the Law, and the Amount, of the change;
give us the Independent Variable, the Formula, and
the Coefficients, respectively.</p>
<p class="end">We now proceed to offer some suggestions of methods
by which each of these steps may be in some degree
promoted. <span class="pagenum" id="page190">190</span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the
Selection of the Fundamental Idea.</i></p>
<p id="b3c5a5">5. When we turn our thoughts upon any assemblage of
facts, with a view of collecting from them
some connexion or law, the most important step, and
at the same time that in which rules can least aid us, is
the Selection of the Idea by which they are to be
collected. So long as this idea has not been detected,
all seems to be hopeless confusion or insulated facts;
when the connecting idea has been caught sight of, we
constantly regard the facts with reference to their
connexion, and wonder that it should be possible for
any one to consider them in any other point of view.</p>
<p>Thus the different seasons, and the various aspects
of the heavenly bodies, might at first appear to be
direct manifestations from some superior power, which
man could not even understand: but it was soon found
that the ideas of time and space, of motion and recurrence,
would give coherency to many of the phenomena. Yet this
took place by successive steps. Eclipses,
for a long period, seemed to follow no law; and being
very remarkable events, continued to be deemed the
indications of a supernatural will, after the common
motions of the heavens were seen to be governed by
relations of time and space. At length, however, the
Chaldeans discovered that, after a period of eighteen
years, similar sets of eclipses recur; and, thus selecting
the idea of <em>time</em>, simply, as that to which these events
were to be referred, they were able to reduce them to
rule; and from that time, eclipses were recognized as
parts of a regular order of things. We may, in the
same manner, consider any other course of events, and
may enquire by what idea they are bound together.
For example, if we take the weather, years peculiarly
wet or dry, hot and cold, productive and unproductive,
follow each other in a manner which, at first sight at
least, seems utterly lawless and irregular. Now can we
in any way discover some rule and order in these
occurrences? Is there, for example, in these events,
as in eclipses, a certain cycle of years, after which like <span class="pagenum" id="page191">191</span>
seasons come round again? or does the weather depend
upon the force of some extraneous body&mdash;for instance,
the moon&mdash;and follow in some way her aspects? or
would the most proper way of investigating this subject
be to consider the effect of the moisture and heat of
various tracts of the earth’s surface upon the ambient
air? It is at our choice to <em>try</em> these and other modes
of obtaining a science of the weather: that is, we may
refer the phenomena to the idea of <em>time</em>, introducing
the conception of a cycle;&mdash;or to the idea of external
<em>force</em>, by the conception of the moon’s action;&mdash;or to the
idea of <em>mutual action</em>, introducing the conceptions of
thermotical and atmological agencies, operating between
different regions of earth, water, and air.</p>
<p id="b3c5a6">6. It may be asked, How are we to decide in such
alternatives? How are we to select the one right idea
out of several conceivable ones? To which we can only
reply, that this must be done by <em>trying</em> which will
succeed. If there really exist a cycle of the weather, as
well as of eclipses, this must be established by comparing
the asserted cycle with a good register of the seasons,
of sufficient extent. Or if the moon really influence
the meteorological conditions of the air, the asserted
influence must be compared with the observed facts,
and so accepted or rejected. When Hipparchus had
observed the increase of longitude of the stars, the idea
of a motion of the celestial sphere suggested itself as
the explanation of the change; but this thought was
<em>verified</em> only by observing several stars.
It was conceivable that each star should have an independent
motion, governed by time only, or by other circumstances,
instead of being regulated by its place in the
sphere; and this possibility could be rejected by trial
alone. In like manner, the original opinion of the
composition of bodies supposed the compounds to derive
their properties from the elements according to the law
of <em>likeness</em>; but this opinion was overturned by a
thousand facts; and thus the really applicable Idea
of Chemical Composition was introduced in modern
times. In what has already been said on the History
of Ideas, we have seen how each science was in a state <span class="pagenum" id="page192">192</span>
of confusion and darkness till the right idea was introduced.</p>
<p id="b3c5a7">7. No general method of evolving such ideas can be
given. Such events appear to result from a peculiar
sagacity and felicity of mind;&mdash;never without labour,
never without preparation;&mdash;yet with no constant dependence
upon preparation, or upon labour, or even
entirely upon personal endowments. Newton explained
the colours which refraction produces, by referring
each colour to a peculiar <em>angle of refraction</em>,
thus introducing the right idea. But when the same philosopher
tried to explain the colours produced by diffraction, he
erred, by attempting to apply the same idea, (<i>the course
of a single ray</i>,) instead of applying the truer idea, of
the <em>interference of two rays</em>. Newton gave a wrong
rule for the double refraction of Iceland spar, by
making the refraction depend on the <em>edges</em> of the rhombohedron:
Huyghens, more happy, introduced the
idea of the <em>axis of symmetry</em> of the solid, and thus was
able to give the true law of the phenomena.</p>
<p id="b3c5a8">8. Although the selected idea is proved to be the
right one, only when the true law of nature is established
by means of it, yet it often happens that there
prevails a settled conviction respecting the relation
which must afford the key to the phenomena, before
the selection has been confirmed by the laws to which
it leads. Even before the empirical laws of the tides
were made out, it was not doubtful that these laws
depended upon the places and motions of the sun and
moon. We know that the crystalline form of a body
must depend upon its chemical composition, though
we are as yet unable to assign the law of this dependence.</p>
<p>Indeed in most cases of great discoveries, the right
idea to which the facts were to be referred, was selected
by many philosophers, before the decisive demonstration
that it was the right idea, was given by the
discoverer. Thus Newton showed that the motions of
the planets might be explained by means of a central
force in the sun: but though he established, he did not
first select the idea involved in the conception of a <span class="pagenum" id="page193">193</span>
central force. The idea had already been sufficiently
pointed out, dimly by Kepler, more clearly by Borelli,
Huyghens, Wren, and Hooke. Indeed this anticipation of
the true idea is always a principal part of that
which, in the <i>History of the Sciences</i>, we have termed
the <i>Prelude</i> of a Discovery. The two steps of <em>proposing</em>
a philosophical problem, and of <em>solving</em> it, are, as
we have elsewhere said, both important, and are often
performed by different persons. The former step is, in
fact, the Selection of the Idea. In explaining any
change, we have to discover first the <em>Argument</em>, and
then the <em>Law</em> of the change. The selection of the
Argument is the step of which we here speak; and is
that in which inventiveness of mind and justness of
thought are mainly shown.</p>
<p id="b3c5a9">9. Although, as we have said, we can give few precise directions
for this cardinal process, the Selection of
the Idea, in speculating on phenomena, yet there is
one Rule which may have its use: it is this:&mdash;<em>The idea
and the facts must be homogeneous</em>: the elementary
Conceptions, into which the facts have been decomposed,
must be of the same nature as the Idea by
which we attempt to collect them into laws. Thus, if
facts have been observed and measured by reference to
space, they must be bound together by the idea of
space: if we would obtain a knowledge of mechanical
forces in the solar system, we must observe mechanical
phenomena. Kepler erred against this rule in his
attempts at obtaining physical laws of the system; for
the facts which he took were the <em>velocities</em>, not the
<em>changes of velocity</em>, which are really the mechanical
facts. Again, there has been a transgression of this
Rule committed by all chemical philosophers who have
attempted to assign the relative position of the elementary
particles of bodies in their component molecules. For their
purpose has been to discover the
<em>relations</em> of the particles in <em>space</em>; and yet they have
neglected the only facts in the constitution of bodies
which have a reference to space&mdash;namely, <em>crystalline
form</em>, and <em>optical properties</em>. No progress can be made
in the theory of the elementary structure of bodies, <span class="pagenum" id="page194">194</span>
without making these classes of facts the main basis of
our speculations.</p>
<p id="b3c5a10">10. The only other Rule which I have to offer on
this subject, is that which I have already given:&mdash;<em>the
Idea must be tested by the facts</em>. It must be tried by
applying to the facts the conceptions which are derived
from the idea, and not accepted till some of these succeed
in giving the law of the phenomena. The justice
of the suggestion cannot be known otherwise than by
making the trial. If we can discover a <em>true law</em> by
employing any conceptions, the idea from which these
conceptions are derived is the <em>right</em> one; nor can there
be any proof of its rightness so complete and satisfactory,
as that we are by it led to a solid and permanent
truth.</p>
<p>This, however, can hardly be termed a Rule; for
when we would know, to conjecture and to try the
truth of our conjecture by a comparison with the facts,
is the natural and obvious dictate of common sense.</p>
<p class="end">Supposing the Idea which we adopt, or which we
would try, to be now fixed upon, we still have before
us the range of many Conceptions derived from it;
many Formulæ may be devised depending on the same
Independent Variable, and we must now consider how
our selection among these is to be made.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N
speaking of the discovery of laws of nature,
those which depend upon <em>quantity</em>, as number,
space, and the like, are most prominent and most easily
conceived, and therefore in speaking of such researches,
we shall often use language which applies peculiarly to <span class="pagenum" id="page196">196</span>
the cases in which quantities numerically measurable
are concerned, leaving it for a subsequent task to extend
our principles to ideas of other kinds.</p>
<p>Hence we may at present consider the Construction
of a Conception which shall include and connect the
facts, as being the construction of a Mathematical Formula,
coinciding with the numerical expression of the
facts; and we have to consider how this process can be
facilitated, it being supposed that we have already before
us the numerical measures given by observation.</p>
<p id="b3c6a2">2. We may remark, however, that the construction
of the right Formula for any such case, and the determination
of the Coefficients of such formula, which we
have spoken of as two separate steps, are in practice
almost necessarily simultaneous; for the near coincidence
of the results of the theoretical rule with the
observed facts confirms at the same time the Formula
and its Coefficients. In this case also, the mode of
arriving at truth is to try various hypotheses;&mdash;to
modify the hypotheses so as to approximate to the
facts, and to multiply the facts so as to test the hypotheses.</p>
<p>The Independent Variable, and the Formula which
we would try, being once selected, mathematicians have
devised certain special and technical processes by which
the value of the coefficients may be determined. These
we shall treat of in the <a href="#page202">next</a> Chapter; but in the mean
time we may note, in a more general manner, the mode
in which, in physical researches, the proper formula
may be obtained.</p>
<p id="b3c6a3">3. A person somewhat versed in mathematics, having before
him a series of numbers, will generally be
able to devise a formula which approaches near to
those numbers. If, for instance, the series is constantly
progressive, he will be able to see whether it
more nearly resembles an arithmetical or a geometrical
progression. For example, MM. Dulong and Petit, in
their investigation of the law of cooling of bodies,
obtained the following series of measures. A thermometer,

<p class="noind eq">and so on. Now this series of numbers manifestly increases
with greater rapidity as we proceed from the
lower to the higher parts of the scale. The numbers
do not, however, form a geometrical series, as we may
easily ascertain. But if we were to take the differences
of the successive terms we should find them to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="eq center">1·88, 1·41, 1·30, 1·21, 1·01, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The physical law expressed by the formula just
spoken of is this:&mdash;that when a body is cooling in an
empty inclosure which is kept at a constant temperature,
the quickness of the cooling, for excesses of temperature
in arithmetical progression, increases as the
terms of a geometrical progression, diminished by a
constant number.</p>
<p id="b3c6a4">4. In the actual investigation of Dulong and Petit,
however, the formula was not obtained in precisely the
manner just described. For the quickness of cooling
depends upon two elements, the temperature of the hot
body and the temperature of the inclosure; not merely
upon the <em>excess</em> of one of these over the other. And
it was found most convenient, first, to make such experiments
as should exhibit the dependence of the velocity of cooling
upon the temperature of the enclosure;
which dependence is contained in the following law:&mdash;The
quickness of cooling of a thermometer in vacuo
for a constant excess of temperature, increases in geometric
progression, when the temperature of the inclosure increases
in arithmetic progression. From this
law the preceding one follows by necessary
consequence<a id="fnanchor27-3" href="#note27-3"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-3" href="#fnanchor27-3">27</a>
</span> For if <i>θ</i> be the temperature of the inclosure,
and <i>t</i> the excess of temperature of the hot body, it appears,
by this law, that the radiation of heat is as <i>a<sup>θ</sup></i>. And hence
the quickness of cooling, which is as the excess of radiation,
is as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>a<sup>θ + t</sup></i> &minus; <i>a<sup>θ</sup></i></span>;
that is, as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>a<sup>θ</sup></i>(<i>a<sup>t</sup></i> &minus; 1)</span>
which agrees with the formula given in the last note.<br />
&emsp;The whole of this series of researches of Dulong and Petit is
full of the most beautiful and instructive artifices for the
construction of the proper formulæ in physical research.
</div>
<p>This example may serve to show the nature of the
artifices which may be used for the construction of
formulæ, when we have a constantly progressive series
of numbers to represent. We must not only endeavour
by trial to contrive a formula which will answer the
conditions, but we must vary our experiments so as to
determine, first one factor or portion of the formula,
and then the other; and we must use the most
<span class="pagenum" id="page199">199</span> probable
hypothesis as means of suggestion for our formulæ.</p>
<p id="b3c6a5">5. In a <em>progressive</em> series of numbers, unless the
formula which we adopt be really that which expresses
the law of nature, the deviations of the formula from
the facts will generally become enormous, when the
experiments are extended into new parts of the scale.
True formulæ for a progressive series of results can
hardly ever be obtained from a very limited range of
experiments: just as the attempt to guess the general
course of a road or a river, by knowing two or three
points of it in the neighbourhood of one another, would
generally fail. In the investigation respecting the
laws of the cooling of bodies just noticed, one great
advantage of the course pursued by the experimenters
was, that their experiments included so great a range
of temperatures. The attempts to assign the law of
elasticity of steam deduced from experiments made
with moderate temperatures, were found to be enormously
wrong, when very high temperatures were
made the subject of experiment. It is easy to see that
this must be so: an arithmetical and a geometrical
series may nearly coincide for a few terms moderately
near each other: but if we take remote corresponding
terms in the two series, one of these will be very many
times the other. And hence, from a narrow range of
experiments, we may infer one of these series when we
ought to infer the other; and thus obtain a law which
is widely erroneous.</p>
<p id="b3c6a6">6. In Astronomy, the series of observations which
we have to study are, for the most part, not progressive,
but <em>recurrent</em>. The numbers observed do not go on
constantly increasing; but after increasing up to a certain
amount they diminish; then, after a certain space,
increase again; and so on, changing constantly through
certain <em>cycles</em>. In cases in which the observed numbers
are of this kind, the formula which expresses them
must be a <em>circular function</em>, of some sort or other;
involving, for instance, sines, tangents, and other forms
of calculation, which have recurring values when the
angle on which they depend goes on constantly <span class="pagenum" id="page200">200</span>
increasing. The main business of formal astronomy consists
in resolving the celestial phenomena into a series
of <i>terms</i> of this kind, in detecting their <i>arguments</i>, and
in determining their <i>coefficients</i>.</p>
<p id="b3c6a7">7. In constructing the formulæ by which laws of
nature are expressed, although the first object is to
assign the Law of the Phenomena, philosophers have,
in almost all cases, not proceeded in a purely empirical
manner, to connect the observed numbers by some expression
of calculation, but have been guided, in the
selection of their formula, by some <em>Hypothesis</em>
respecting the mode of connexion of the facts.
Thus the formula of Dulong and Petit above given was suggested
by the Theory of Exchanges; the first attempts at the
resolution of the heavenly motions into circular functions
were clothed in the hypothesis of Epicycles. And
this was almost inevitable. ‘We must confess,’ says
Copernicus<a id="fnanchor28-3" href="#note28-3"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>,
‘that the celestial motions are circular,
or compounded of several circles, since their inequalities
observe a fixed law, and recur in value at certain
intervals, which could not be except they were circular:
for a circle alone can make that quantity which
has occurred recur again.’ In like manner the first
publication of the <i>Law of the Sines</i>, the true formula of
optical refraction, was accompanied by Descartes with
an hypothesis, in which an explanation of the law was
pretended. In such cases, the mere comparison of
observations may long fail in suggesting the true formulæ.
The fringes of shadows and other diffracted
colours were studied in vain by Newton, Grimaldi,
Comparetti, the elder Herschel, and Mr. Brougham,
so long as these inquirers attempted merely to trace
the laws of the facts as they appeared in themselves;
while Young, Fresnel, Fraunhofer, Schwerdt, and
others, determined these laws in the most rigorous
manner, when they applied to the observations the
Hypothesis of Interferences.</p>

can afford, the construction of true formulæ, in <span class="pagenum" id="page201">201</span>
those cardinal discoveries by which the progress of
science has mainly been caused, has been a matter of
great labour and difficulty, and of good fortune added
to sagacity. In the <i>History of Science</i>, we have seen
how long and how hard Kepler laboured, before he
converted the formula for the planetary motions, from
an <em>epicyclical</em> combination, to a simple <em>ellipse</em>. The same
philosopher, labouring with equal zeal and perseverance
to discover the formula of optical refraction, which
now appears to us so simple, was utterly foiled. Malus
sought in vain the formula determining the Angle at
which a transparent surface polarizes light: Sir D.
Brewster<a id="fnanchor29-3" href="#note29-3"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>,
with a happy sagacity, discovered
the formula to be simply this, that the <em>index</em> of refraction is
the <em>tangent</em> of the angle of polarization.</p>

<p class="end">Though we cannot give rules which will be of
much service when we have thus to divine the general
form of the relation by which phenomena are connected,

special methods of obtaining laws
from Observations. Of these we shall now proceed to

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLIII.</p>
<p><i>There are special Methods of Induction applicable to
Quantity; of which the principal are, the</i> Method of Curves,
<i>the</i> Method of Means, <i>the</i> Method of Least Squares, <i>and
the</i> Method of Residues.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLIV.</p>
<p>The Method of Curves <i>consists in drawing a curve of
which the observed quantities are the Ordinates, the quantity
on which the change of these quantities depends being the
Abscissa. The efficacy of this Method depends upon the
faculty which the eye possesses, of readily detecting regularity
and irregularity in forms. The Method may be used
to detect the Laws which the observed quantities follow: and
also, when the Observations are inexact, it may be used to correct
these Observations, so as to obtain data more true than the
observed facts themselves.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLV.</p>
<p>The Method of Means <i>gets rid of irregularities by taking
the arithmetical mean of a great number of observed quantities.
Its efficacy depends upon this; that in cases in which
observed quantities are affected by other inequalities, besides
that of which we wish to determine the law, the excesses</i> above
<i>and defects</i> below <i>the quantities which the law in question
would produce, will, in a collection of</i> many <i>observations</i>,
balance <i>each other.</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page203">203</span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLVI.</p>
<p>The Method of Least Squares <i>is a Method of Means, in
which the mean is taken according to the condition, that the
sum of the squares of the errours of observation shall be the
least possible which the law of the facts allows. It appears,
by the Doctrine of Chances, that this is the</i> most probable
<i>mean.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLVII.</p>
<p>The Method of Residues <i>consists in subtracting, from
the quantities given by Observation, the quantity given by any
Law already discovered; and then examining the remainder,
or</i> Residue, <i>in order to discover the leading Law which it
follows. When this second Law has been discovered, the
quantity given by it may be subtracted from the first Residue;
thus giving a</i> Second Residue, <i>which may be examined in
the same manner; and so on. The efficacy of this method
depends principally upon the circumstance of the Laws of
variation being successively smaller and smaller in amount
(or at least in their mean effect); so that the ulterior undiscovered
Laws do not prevent the Law in question from being</i>
prominent <i>in the observations.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XLVIII.</p>
<p class="end"><i>The Method of Means and the Method of Least Squares
cannot be applied without our</i> knowing the Arguments <i>of
the Inequalities which we seek. The Method of Curves and
the Method of Residues, when the Arguments of the principal
Inequalities are known, often make it easy to find the others.</i></p>
<p class="drop end"><span class="sc">IN</span> cases where the phenomena admit of numerical
measurement and expression, certain mathematical methods
may be employed to facilitate and give
accuracy to the determination of the formula by which
the observations are connected into laws. Among the
most usual and important of these Methods are the
following:&mdash; <span class="pagenum" id="page204">204</span><br />

&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;IV. <a href="#b3c7a15">The Method of Residues</a>.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect. I.</span>&mdash;<i>The Method of Curves.</i></p>
<p id="b3c7a1">1. <span class="sc">The</span> Method of Curves proceeds upon this basis;
that when one quantity undergoes a series of changes
depending on the progress of another quantity, (as, for
instance, the Deviation of the Moon from her equable
place depends upon the progress of Time,) this dependence
may be expressed by means of a <i>curve</i>. In the
language of mathematicians, the variable quantity,
whose changes we would consider, is made the <i>ordinate</i>
of the curve, and the quantity on which the
changes depend is made the <i>abscissa</i>. In this manner,
the curve will exhibit in its form a series of undulations,
rising and falling so as to correspond with the
alternate Increase and Diminution of the quantity represented,
at intervals of Space which correspond to
the intervals of Time, or other quantity by which the
changes are regulated. Thus, to take another example,
if we set up, at equal intervals, a series of ordinates
representing the Height of all the successive High Waters
brought by the tides at a given place, for a year, the
curve which connects the summits of all these ordinates
will exhibit a series of undulations, ascending
and descending once in about each Fortnight; since, in
that interval, we have, in succession, the high spring
tides and the low neap tides. The curve thus drawn
offers to the eye a picture of the order and magnitude
of the changes to which the quantity under contemplation,
(the height of high water,) is subject.</p>
<p id="b3c7a2">2. Now the peculiar facility and efficacy of the
Method of Curves depends upon this circumstance;&mdash;that
order and regularity are more readily and clearly
recognized, when thus exhibited to the eye in a picture,
than they are when presented to the mind in any other
manner. To detect the relations of Number considered
directly as Number, is not easy: and we might <span class="pagenum" id="page205">205</span>
contemplate for a long time a Table of recorded Numbers
without perceiving the order of their increase and
diminution, even if the law were moderately simple;
as any one may satisfy himself by looking at a Tide
Table. But if these Numbers are expressed by the
magnitude of <i>Lines</i>, and if these Lines are arranged in
regular order, the eye readily discovers the rule of
their changes: it follows the curve which runs along
their extremities, and takes note of the order in which
its convexities and concavities succeed each other, if
any order be readily discoverable. The separate observations
are in this manner compared and generalized
and reduced to rule by the eye alone. And the eye,
so employed, detects relations of order and succession
with a peculiar celerity and evidence. If, for example,
we thus arrive as ordinates the prices of corn in each
year for a series of years, we shall see the order,
rapidity, and amount of the increase and decrease of price,
far more clearly than in any other manner. And if
there were any recurrence of increase and decrease at
stated intervals of years, we should in this manner
perceive it. The eye, constantly active and busy, and
employed in making into shapes the hints and traces
of form which it contemplates, runs along the curve
thus offered to it; and as it travels backwards and
forwards, is ever on the watch to detect some resemblance
or contrast between one part and another. And
these resemblances and contrasts, when discovered, are
the images of Laws of Phenomena; which are made
manifest at once by this artifice, although the mind
could not easily catch the indications of their existence,
if they were not thus reflected to her in the clear
mirror of Space.</p>
<p>Thus when we have a series of good Observations,
and know the argument upon which their change of
magnitude depends, the Method of Curves enables us to
ascertain, almost at a glance, the law of the change; and
by further attention, may be made to give us a formula
with great accuracy. The Method enables us to perceive,
among our observations, an order, which without the
method, is concealed in obscurity and perplexity. <span class="pagenum" id="page206">206</span></p>
<p id="b3c7a3">3. But the Method of Curves not only enables us
to obtain laws of nature from <em>good</em> Observations, but
also, in a great degree, from observations which are
very <em>imperfect</em>. For the imperfection of observations
may in part be corrected by this consideration;&mdash;that
though they may appear irregular, the correct facts
which they imperfectly represent, are really regular.
And the Method of Curves enables us to remedy this
apparent irregularity, at least in part. For when
Observations thus imperfect are laid down as Ordinates,
and their extremities connected by a line, we obtain,
not a smooth and flowing curve, such as we should
have if the observations contained only the rigorous
results of regular laws; but a broken and irregular
line, full of sudden and capricious twistings, and
bearing on its face marks of irregularities dependent, not
upon law, but upon chance. Yet these irregular and
abrupt deviations in the curve are, in most cases, but
small in extent, when compared with those bendings
which denote the effects of regular law. And this
circumstance is one of the great grounds of advantage
in the Method of Curves. For when the observations
thus laid down present to the eye such a broken and
irregular line, we can still see, often with great ease
and certainty, what twistings of the line are probably
due to the irregular errours of observation; and can
at once reject these, by drawing a more regular curve,
cutting off all such small and irregular sinuosities,
leaving some to the right and some to the left; and
then proceeding as if this regular curve, and not the
irregular one, expressed the observations. In this
manner, we suppose the errours of observation to
balance each other; some of our corrected measures
being too great and others too small, but with no great
preponderance either way. We draw our main regular
curve, not <em>through</em> the points given by our observations,
but <em>among</em> them: drawing it, as has been said
by one of the philosophers<a id="fnanchor30-3" href="#note30-3"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a>
who first systematically
used this method, ‘with a bold but careful hand.’ <span class="pagenum" id="page207">207</span>
The regular curve which we thus obtain, thus freed
from the casual errours of observation, is that in which
we endeavour to discover the laws of change and succession.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-3" href="#fnanchor30-3">30</a>
</span> Sir J. Herschel, <i>Ast. Soc. Trans.</i> vol. v. p. 1.
</div>
<p id="b3c7a4">4. By this method, thus getting rid at once, in a
great measure, of errours of observation, we obtain
data which are <em>more true than the</em> individual <em>facts
themselves</em>. The philosopher’s business is to compare
his hypotheses with facts, as we have often said. But
if we make the comparison with separate special facts,
we are liable to be perplexed or misled, to an unknown
amount, by the errours of observation; which may
cause the hypothetical and the observed result to agree,
or to disagree, when otherwise they would not do so.
If, however, we thus take the <em>whole mass of the facts</em>,
and remove the errours of actual
observation<a id="fnanchor31-3" href="#note31-3"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>, by
making the curve which expresses the supposed observation
regular and smooth, we have the separate facts
corrected by their general tendency. We are put in
possession, as we have said, of something more true
than any fact by itself is.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note31-3" href="#fnanchor31-3">31</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> vol. v. p. 4.
</div>
<p>One of the most admirable examples of the use of
this Method of Curves is found in Sir John Herschel’s
<i>Investigation of the Orbits of Double
Stars</i><a id="fnanchor32-3" href="#note32-3"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>. The author
there shows how far inferior the direct observations of
the angle of position are, to the observations corrected
by a curve in the manner above stated. ‘This curve
once drawn,’ he says, ‘must represent, it is evident,
the law of variation of the angle of position, with the
time, not only for instants intermediate between the
dates of observations, but even at the moments of
observation themselves, much better than the individual
<em>raw</em> observations can possibly (on an average) do.
It is only requisite to try a case or two, to be satisfied
that by substituting the curve for the points, we have
made a nearer approach to nature, and in a great
measure eliminated errours of observation.’ ‘In
following the graphical process,’ he adds, ‘we have a
conviction almost approaching to moral certainty that <span class="pagenum" id="page208">208</span>
we cannot be greatly misled.’ Again, having thus
corrected the raw observations, he makes another use
of the graphical method, by trying whether an ellipse
can be drawn ‘if not <em>through</em>, at least <em>among</em> the
points, so as to approach tolerably near them all; and
thus approaching to the orbit which is the subject of
investigation.’</p>

</div>
<p id="b3c7a5">5. The <em>Obstacles</em> which principally impede the
application of the Method of Curves are (I.) our <em>ignorance
of the arguments</em> of the changes, and (II.) the <em>complication
of several laws</em> with one another.</p>
<p>(I.) If we do not know on what quantity those
changes depend which we are studying, we may fail
entirely in detecting the law of the changes, although
we throw the observations into curves. For the true
<em>argument</em> of the change should, in fact, be made the
<em>abscissa</em> of the curve. If we were to express, by a
series of ordinates, the <em>hour</em> of high water on
successive days, we should not obtain, or should obtain very
imperfectly, the law which these times follow; for the
real argument of this change is not the <em>solar hour</em>, but
the <em>hour</em> at which the <em>moon</em> passes the meridian. But
if we are supposed to be aware that <em>this</em> is the <em>argument</em>,
(which theory suggests and trial instantly confirms) we then do
immediately obtain the primary
Rules of the Time of High Water, by throwing a series
of observations into a Curve, with the Hour of the
Moon’s Transit for the abscissa.</p>
<p>In like manner, when we have obtained the first
great or Semi-mensual Inequality of the tides, if we
endeavour to discover the laws of other Inequalities by
means of curves, we must take from theory the suggestion
that the Arguments of such inequalities will
probably be the <em>parallax</em> and the <em>declination</em> of the
moon. This suggestion again is confirmed by trial;
but if we were supposed to be entirely ignorant of the
dependence of the changes of the tide on the Distance
and Declination of the moon, the curves would exhibit
unintelligible and seemingly capricious changes. For
by the effect of the Inequality arising from the Parallax,
the convexities of the curves which belong to the <span class="pagenum" id="page209">209</span>
spring tides, are in some years made alternately greater
and less all the year through; while in other years
they are made all nearly equal. This difference does
not betray its origin, till we refer it to the Parallax;
and the same difficulty in proceeding would arise if we
were ignorant that the moon’s Declination is one of the
Arguments of tidal changes.</p>
<p>In like manner, if we try to reduce to law any meteorological
changes, those of the Height of the Barometer for instance,
we find that we can make little
progress in the investigation, precisely because we do
not know the Argument on which these changes depend.
That there is a certain regular <em>diurnal</em> change
of small amount, we know; but when we have abstracted
this Inequality, (of which the Argument is the <em>time of
day</em>,) we find far greater Changes left behind, from day
to day and from hour to hour; and we express these
in curves, but we cannot reduce them to Rule, because
we cannot discover on what numerical quantity they
depend. The assiduous study of barometrical observations,
thrown into curves, may perhaps hereafter point
out to us what are the relations of time and space by
which these variations are determined; but in the
mean time, this subject exemplifies to us our remark,
that the method of curves is of comparatively small
use, so long as we are in ignorance of the real
Arguments of the Inequalities.</p>
<p id="b3c7a6">6. (II.) In the next place, I remark that a difficulty
is thrown in the way of the Method of Curves by
<i>the Combination of several laws</i> one with another. It
will readily be seen that such a cause will produce a
complexity in the curves which exhibit the succession
of facts. If, for example, we take the case of the Tides,
the Height of high water increases and diminishes with
the Approach of the sun to, and its Recess from, the
syzygies of the moon. Again, this Height increases
and diminishes as the moon’s Parallax increases and
diminishes; and again, the Height diminishes when
the Declination increases, and <i>vice versa</i>; and all these
Arguments of change, the Distance from Syzygy, the
Parallax, the Declination, complete their circuit and <span class="pagenum" id="page210">210</span>
return into themselves in different periods. Hence
the curve which represents the Height of high water
has not any periodical interval in which it completes
its changes and commences a new cycle. The sinuosity
which would arise from each Inequality separately
considered, interferes with, disguises, and conceals the
others; and when we first cast our eyes on the curve
of observation, it is very far from offering any obvious
regularity in its form. And it is to be observed that
we have not yet enumerated <em>all</em> the elements of this
complexity: for there are changes of the tide depending
upon the Parallax and Declination of the Sun as
well as of the Moon. Again; besides these changes, of
which the Arguments are obvious, there are others, as
those depending upon the Barometer and the Wind,
which follow no known regular law, and which constantly
affect and disturb the results produced by other
laws.</p>
<p class="end">In the Tides, and in like manner in the motions of
the Moon, we have very eminent examples of the way
in which the discovery of laws may be rendered difficult
by the number of laws which operate to affect the
same quantity. In such cases, the Inequalities are
generally picked out in succession, nearly in the order
of their magnitudes. In this way there were successively
collected, from the study of the Moon’s motions
by a series of astronomers, those Inequalities which we
term the <i>Equation of the Center</i>, the <i>Evection</i>, the
<i>Variation</i>, and the <i>Annual Equation</i>.
These Inequalities were not, in fact, obtained by the application of
the Method of Curves; but the Method of Curves
might have been applied to such a case with great advantage.
The Method has been applied with great
industry and with remarkable success to the investigation
of the laws of the Tides; and by the use of it,
a series of Inequalities both of the Times and of the
Heights of high water has been detected, which explain
all the main features of the observed facts. <span class="pagenum" id="page211">211</span></p>
<p class="center" id="b3c7a7"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&mdash;<i>The Method of Means.</i></p>
<p>7. The Method of Curves, as we have endeavoured
to explain above, frees us from the casual and extraneous
irregularities which arise from the imperfection
of observation; and thus lays bare the results of the
laws which really operate, and enables us to proceed in
search of those laws. But the Method of Curves is
not the only one which effects such a purpose. The
errours arising from detached observations may be got
rid of, and the additional accuracy which multiplied
observations give may be obtained, by operations upon
the observed numbers, without expressing them by
spaces. The process of curves assumes that the errours
of observation balance each other;&mdash;that the accidental
excesses and defects are nearly equal in amount;&mdash;that
the true quantities which would have been observed
if all accidental causes of irregularity were removed,
are obtained, exactly or nearly, by selecting quantities,
upon the whole, equally distant from the extremes of
great and small, which our imperfect observations offer
to us. But when, among a number of unequal quantities,
we take a quantity equally distant from the
greater and the smaller, this quantity is termed the
<i>Mean</i> of the unequal quantities. Hence the correction
of our observations by the method of curves consists in
taking the Mean of the observations.</p>
<p id="b3c7a8">8. Now without employing curves, we may proceed
arithmetically to take the Mean of all the observed
numbers of each class. Thus, if we wished to know
the Height of the spring tide at a given place, and if
we found that four different spring tides were measured
as being of the height of ten, thirteen, eleven,
and fourteen feet, we should conclude that the true
height of the tide was the <i>Mean</i> of these numbers,&mdash;namely,
twelve feet; and we should suppose that the
deviation from this height, in the individual cases,
arose from the accidents of weather, the imperfections
of observation, or the operation of other laws, besides
the alternation of spring and neap tides. <span class="pagenum" id="page212">212</span></p>
<p>This process of finding the Mean of an assemblage of
observed numbers is much practised in discovering,
and still more in confirming and correcting, laws of
phenomena. We shall notice a few of its peculiarities.</p>
<p id="b3c7a9">9. The Method of Means requires a knowledge of
the <em>Argument</em> of the changes which we would study;
for the numbers must be arranged in certain Classes,
before we find the Mean of each Class; and the principle
on which this arrangement depends is the Argument. This
knowledge of the Argument is more indispensably necessary
in the Method of Means than in
the Method of Curves; for when Curves are drawn, the
eye often spontaneously detects the law of recurrence in
their sinuosities; but when we have collections of
Numbers, we must divide them into classes by a selection
of our own. Thus, in order to discover the law
which the heights of the tide follow, in the progress
from spring to neap, we arrange the observed tides
according to the <em>day of the moon’s age</em>; and we then
take the mean of all those which thus happen at the
<em>same period</em> of the Moon’s Revolution. In this manner
we obtain the law which we seek; and the process is
very nearly the same in all other applications of this
Method of Means. In all cases, we begin by assuming
the Classes of measures which we wish to compare, the
Law which we could confirm or correct, the Formula
of which we would determine the coefficients.</p>
<p id="b3c7a10">10. The Argument being thus assumed, the Method
of Means is very efficacious in ridding our inquiry of
errours and irregularities which would impede and perplex
it. Irregularities which are altogether accidental,
or at least accidental with reference to some law which
we have under consideration, compensate each other in
a very remarkable way, when we take the Means of
<em>many</em> observations. If we have before us a collection
of observed tides, some of them may be elevated, some
depressed by the wind, some noted too high and some
too low by the observer, some augmented and some
diminished by uncontemplated changes in the moon’s
distance or motion: but in the course of a year or two
at the longest, all these causes of irregularity balance <span class="pagenum" id="page213">213</span>
each other; and the law of succession, which runs
through the observations, comes out as precisely as if
those disturbing influences did not exist. In any particular
case, there appears to be no possible reason why
the deviation should be in one way, or of one moderate
amount, rather than another. But taking the mass of
observations together, the deviations in opposite ways
will be of equal amount, with a degree of exactness
very striking. This is found to be the case in all
inquiries where we have to deal with observed numbers
upon a large scale. In the progress of the population
of a country, for instance, what can appear more
inconstant, in detail, than the causes which produce births
and deaths? yet in each country, and even in each
province of a country, the proportions of the whole
numbers of births and deaths remain nearly constant.
What can be more seemingly beyond the reach of rule
than the occasions which produce letters that cannot
find their destination? yet it appears that the number
of ‘dead letters’ is nearly the same from year to year.
And the same is the result when the deviations arise,
not from mere accident, but from laws perfectly regular,
though not contemplated in our
investigation<a id="fnanchor33-3" href="#note33-3"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>.
Thus the effects of the Moon’s Parallax upon the Tides,
sometimes operating one way and sometimes another,
according to certain rules, are quite eliminated by
taking the Means of a long series of observations; the
excesses and defects neutralizing each other, so far as
concerns the effect upon any law of the tides which we
would investigate.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-3" href="#fnanchor33-3">33</a>
</span> Provided the argument of the law which we
neglect have no coincidence with the argument of the law
which we would determine.
</div>
<p id="b3c7a11">11. In order to obtain very great accuracy, very
large masses of observations are often employed by
philosophers, and the accuracy of the result increases
with the multitude of observations. The immense collections
of astronomical observations which have in
this manner been employed in order to form and correct
the Tables of the celestial motions are perhaps
the most signal instances of the attempts to obtain <span class="pagenum" id="page214">214</span>
accuracy by this accumulation of observations. Delambre’s
Tables of the Sun are founded upon nearly 3000
observations; Burg’s Tables of the Moon upon above
4000.</p>
<p>But there are other instances hardly less remarkable.
Mr. Lubbock’s first investigations of the laws of
the tides of London<a id="fnanchor34-3" href="#note34-3"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>,
included above 13,000 observations,
extending through nineteen years; it being considered
that this large number was necessary to remove
the effects of accidental causes<a id="fnanchor35-3" href="#note35-3"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>.
And the attempts
to discover the laws of change in the barometer have
led to the performance of labours of equal amount:
Laplace and Bouvard examined this question by means
of observations made at the Observatory of Paris, four
times every day for eight years.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label">
<a id="note34-3" href="#fnanchor34-3">34</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1831.
</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-3" href="#fnanchor35-3">35</a>
</span> This period of nineteen years was also selected for
a reason which is alluded to in a former <a href="#note33-3">note</a>. It was thought
that this period secured the inquirer from the errours
which might be produced by the partial coincidence of the
Arguments of different irregularities; for example,
those due to the moon’s Parallax and to the moon’s Declination. It has
since been found (<i>Phil. Tr.</i> 1838. <i>On the Determination
of the Laws of the Tides from Short Series of Observations</i>),
that with regard to Parallax at least, the Means of one year give
sufficient accuracy.
</div>
<p class="end" id="b3c7a12">12. We may remark one striking evidence of the
accuracy thus obtained by employing large masses of
observations. In this way we may often detect inequalities
much smaller than the errours by which they are
encumbered and concealed. Thus the Diurnal Oscillations
of the Barometer were discovered by the comparison of
observations of many days, classified according to the
hours of the day; and the result was a clear
and incontestable proof of the existence of such oscillations
although the differences which these oscillations
produce at different hours of the day are far smaller
than the casual changes, hitherto reduced to no law,
which go on from hour to hour and from day to day.
The effect of law, operating incessantly and steadily,
makes itself more and more felt as we give it a longer
range; while the effect of accident, followed out in the <span class="pagenum" id="page215">215</span>
same manner, is to annihilate itself, and to disappear
altogether from the result.</p>
<p class="center" id="b3c7a13"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III.&mdash;<i>The Method of Least Squares.</i></p>
<p>13. The Method of Least Squares is in fact a
method of means, but with some peculiar characters.
Its object is to determine the <em>best Mean</em> of a number
of observed quantities; or the <em>most probable Law</em>
derived from a number of observations, of which some,
or all, are allowed to be more or less imperfect. And
the method proceeds upon this supposition;&mdash;that all
errours are not <em>equally</em> probable, but that small
errours are more probable than large ones. By reasoning
mathematically upon this ground, we find that
the best result is obtained (since we cannot obtain a
result in which the errours vanish) by making, not the
<em>Errours</em> themselves, but the <em>Sum of their Squares</em>, of
the <em>smallest</em> possible amount.</p>
<p id="b3c7a14">14. An example may illustrate this. Let a quantity which
is known to increase uniformly, (as the distance of a star
from the meridian at successive instants,) be measured at
equal intervals of time, and be
found to be successively 4, 12, 14. It is plain, upon
the face of these observations, that they are erroneous;
for they ought to form an arithmetical progression, but
they deviate widely from such a progression. But the
question then occurs, what arithmetical progression do
they <em>most probably</em> represent: for we may assume
several arithmetical progressions which more or less
approach the observed series; as for instance, these
three; 4, 9, 14; 6, 10, 14; 5, 10, 15. Now in order
to see the claims of each of these to the truth, we may
tabulate them thus.</p>

<p class="noind eq">Here, although the first series gives the sum of the <span class="pagenum" id="page216">216</span>
errours less than the others, the third series gives the
sum of the squares of the errours least; and is therefore,
by the proposition on which this Method depends,
the <em>most probable</em> series of the three.</p>
<p class="end">This Method, in more extensive and complex cases,
is a great aid to the calculator in his inferences from
facts, and removes much that is arbitrary in the Method
of Means.</p>
<p class="center" id="b3c7a15"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&mdash;<i>The Method of Residues.</i></p>
<p>15. By either of the preceding Methods we obtain,
from observed facts, such Laws as readily offer themselves;
and by the Laws thus discovered, the most prominent
changes of the observed quantities are accounted
for. But in many cases we have, as we have noticed
already, <em>several</em> Laws of nature operating at the same
time, and combining their influences to modify those
quantities which are the subjects of observation. In
these cases we may, by successive applications of the
Methods already pointed out, detect such Laws one
after another: but this successive process, though only
a repetition of what we have already described, offers
some peculiar features which make it convenient to
consider it in a separate Section, as the Method of
Residues.</p>
<p id="b3c7a16">16. When we have, in a series of changes of
a variable quantity, discovered <em>one</em> Law which the
changes follow, detected its Argument, and determined
its Magnitude, so as to explain most clearly the course
of observed facts, we may still find that the observed
changes are not fully accounted for. When we compare
the results of our Law with the observations,
there may be a difference, or as we may term it, a
<i>Residue</i>, still unexplained. But this Residue being
thus detached from the rest, may be examined and
scrutinized in the same manner as the whole observed
quantity was treated at first: and we may in this way
detect in <em>it</em> also a Law of change. If we can do this,
we must accommodate this new found Law as nearly
as possible to the Residue to which it belongs; and <span class="pagenum" id="page217">217</span>
this being done, the difference of our Rule and of the
Residue itself, forms a <i>Second Residue</i>. This Second
Residue we may again bring under our consideration;
and may perhaps in <em>it</em> also discover some Law of change
by which its alterations may be in some measure accounted for.
If this can be done, so as to account for
a large portion of this Residue, the remaining unexplained part
forms a <i>Third Residue</i>; and so on.</p>
<p id="b3c7a17">17. This course has really been followed in various
inquiries, especially in those of Astronomy and Tidology.
The <i>Equation of the Center</i>, for the Moon, was
obtained out of the <i>Residue</i> of the Longitude, which
remained when the <i>Mean Anomaly</i> was taken away.
This Equation being applied and disposed of, the <i>Second
Residue</i> thus obtained, gave to Ptolemy the <i>Evection</i>.
The <i>Third Residue</i>, left by the Equation of the Center
and the Evection, supplied to Tycho the <i>Variation</i>
and the <i>Annual Equation</i>. And the Residue, remaining
from these, has been exhausted by other Equations,
of various arguments, suggested by theory or by observation.
In this case, the successive generations of
astronomers have gone on, each in its turn executing
some step in this Method of Residues. In the examination
of the Tides, on the other hand, this method
has been applied systematically and at once. The
observations readily gave the <i>Semimensual Inequality</i>;
the <i>Residue</i> of this supplied the corrections due to the
Moon’s <i>Parallax</i> and <i>Declination</i>; and when these
were determined, the <i>remaining Residue</i> was explored
for the law of the Solar Correction.</p>
<p id="b3c7a18">18. In a certain degree, the Method of Residues and
the Method of Means are <em>opposite</em> to each other. For
the Method of Residues extricates Laws from their
combination, <em>bringing them into view in succession</em>;
while the Method of Means discovers each Law, not by
bringing the others into view, but by <em>destroying their
effect</em> through an accumulation of observations. By
the Method of Residues we should <em>first</em> extract the
Law of the Parallax Correction of the Tides, and <em>then</em>,
from the Residue left by this, obtain the Declination
Correction. But we might at once employ the Method <span class="pagenum" id="page218">218</span>
of Means, and put together all the cases in which the
Declination was the same; not allowing for the Parallax
in each case, but taking for granted that the
Parallaxes belonging to the same Declination would
neutralize each other; as many falling above as below
the mean Parallax. In cases like this, where the
Method of Means is not impeded by a partial coincidence
of the Arguments of different unknown Inequalities,
it may be employed with almost as much success
as the Method of Residues. But still, when the Arguments
of the Laws are clearly known, as in this instance,
the Method of Residues is more clear and
direct, and is the rather to be recommended.</p>
<p id="b3c7a19">19. If for example, we wish to learn whether the
Height of the Barometer exerts any sensible influence
on the Height of the Sea’s Surface, it would appear
that the most satisfactory mode of proceeding, must be
to subtract, in the first place, what we know to be the
effects of the Moon’s Age, Parallax and Declination,
and other ascertained causes of change; and to search
in the <em>unexplained Residue</em> for the effects of
barometrical pressure. The contrary course has, however,
been adopted, and the effect of the Barometer on the
ocean has been investigated by the direct application
of the Method of Means, classing the observed heights
of the water according to the corresponding heights of
the Barometer without any previous reduction. In
this manner, the suspicion that the tide of the sea is
affected by the pressure of the atmosphere, has been
confirmed. This investigation must be looked upon
as a remarkable instance of the efficacy of the Method
of Means, since the amount of the barometrical effect
is much smaller than the other changes from among
which it was by this process extricated. But an
application of the Method of Residues would still
be desirable on a subject of such extent and difficulty.</p>
<p id="b3c7a20">20. Sir John Herschel, in his <i>Discourse on the
Study of Natural Philosophy</i> (Articles 158&ndash;161), has
pointed out the mode of making discoveries by studying
Residual Phenomena; and has given several illustrations
of the process. In some of these, he has also <span class="pagenum" id="page219">219</span>
considered this method in a wider sense than we have

<p class="noind" id="b3c8a1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
Law of Continuity is applicable to quantity
primarily, and therefore might be associated
with the methods treated of in the last chapter: but
inasmuch as its inferences are made by a transition from
one degree to another among contiguous cases, it will
be found to belong more properly to the Methods of
Induction of which we have now to speak.</p>
<p>The <i>Law of Continuity</i> consists in this proposition,&mdash;That
a quantity cannot pass from one amount to
another by any change of conditions, without passing
through all intermediate degrees of magnitude according
to the intermediate conditions. And this law may
often be employed to correct inaccurate inductions,
and to reject distinctions which have no real foundation
in nature. For example, the Aristotelians made
a distinction between motions according to nature, (as
that of a body falling vertically downwards,) and motions
contrary to nature, (as that of a body moving
along a horizontal plane:) the former, they held, became
naturally quicker and quicker, the latter naturally
slower and slower. But to this it might be replied,
that a horizontal line may pass, by gradual motion,
through various inclined positions, to a vertical
position: and thus the retarded motion may pass into the
accelerated; and hence there must be some inclined
plane on which the motion downwards is naturally
uniform: which is false, and therefore the distinction
of such kinds of motion is unfounded. Again, the
proof of the First Law of Motion depends upon the
Law of Continuity: for since, by diminishing the
resistance to a body moving on a horizontal plane, we
diminish the retardation, and this without limit, the
law of continuity will bring us at the same time to
the case of no resistance and to the case of no retardation.</p>
<p id="b3c8a2">2. The Law of Continuity is asserted by Galileo
in a particular application; and the assertion which it <span class="pagenum" id="page222">222</span>
suggests is by him referred to
Plato;&mdash;namely<a id="fnanchor36-3" href="#note36-3"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> that a
moveable body cannot pass from rest to a determinate
degree of velocity without passing through all smaller
degrees of velocity. This law, however, was first asserted
in a more general and abstract form by
Leibnitz<a id="fnanchor37-3" href="#note37-3"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>:
and was employed by him to show that the laws
of motion propounded by Descartes must be false. The
Third Cartesian Law of Motion was
this<a id="fnanchor38-3" href="#note38-3"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>: that when
one moving body meets another, if the first body have
a less momentum than the second, it will be reflected
with its whole motion: but if the first have a greater
momentum than the second, it will lose a part of its
motion, which it will transfer to the second. Now
each of these cases leads, by the Law of Continuity, to
the case in which the two bodies have <em>equal</em> momentums:
but in this case, by the first part of the law the
body would <em>retain all</em> its motion; and by the second
part of the law it would <em>lose</em> a portion of it: hence the
Cartesian Law is false.</p>

Laws of the Communication of Motion, John Bernoulli
presented an Essay on the subject very ingenious and
profound; in which, however, he denied the existence
of hard bodies, because in the collision of such bodies,
a finite change of motion must take place in an instant:
an event which, on the principle just explained, he
maintained to be impossible.’ And this reasoning
was justifiable: for we can form a <em>continuous</em>
transition from cases in which the impact manifestly
occupies a finite time, (as when we strike a large soft
body) to cases in which it is apparently instantaneous.
Maclaurin and others are disposed, in order to avoid
the conclusion of Bernoulli, to reject the Law of <span class="pagenum" id="page223">223</span>
Continuity. This, however, would not only be, as Playfair
says, to deprive ourselves of an auxiliary, commonly
useful though sometimes deceptive; but what is much
worse, to acquiesce in false propositions, from the want
of clear and patient thinking. For the Law of Continuity,
when rightly interpreted, is <em>never</em> violated in
actual fact. There are not really any such bodies as
have been termed <i>perfectly hard</i>: and if we approach
towards such cases, we must learn the laws of motion
which rule them by attending to the Law of Continuity,
not by rejecting it.</p>

</div>
<p id="b3c8a4">4. Newton used the Law of Continuity to suggest,
but not to prove, the doctrine of universal gravitation.
Let, he said, a terrestrial body be carried as high as
the moon: will it not still fall to the earth? and does
not the moon fall by the same force<a id="fnanchor40-3" href="#note40-3"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a>?
Again: if any
one says that there is a material ether which does not
gravitate<a id="fnanchor41-3" href="#note41-3"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a>,
this kind of matter, by condensation, may
be gradually transmuted to the density of the most
intensely gravitating bodies: and these gravitating
bodies, by taking the internal texture of the condensed
ether, may cease to gravitate; and thus the weight of
bodies depends, not on their quantity of matter, but
on their texture; which doctrine Newton conceived he
had disproved by experiment.</p>

<p id="b3c8a5">5. The evidence of the Law of Continuity resides
in the universality of those Ideas, which enter into
our apprehension of Laws of Nature. When, of two
quantities, one depends upon the other, the Law of
Continuity necessarily governs this dependence. Every
philosopher has the power of applying this law, in
proportion as he has the faculty of apprehending the Ideas
which he employs in his induction, with the same
clearness and steadiness which belong to the fundamental
ideas of Quantity, Space and Number. To those
who possess this faculty, the Law is a Rule of very wide
and decisive application. Its use, as has appeared in the
above examples, is seen rather in the disproof of erroneous
views, and in the correction of false propositions, <span class="pagenum" id="page224">224</span>
than in the invention of new truths. It is a test of
truth, rather than an instrument of discovery.</p>
<p class="end">Methods, however, approaching very near to the
Law of Continuity may be employed as positive means
of obtaining new truths; and these I shall now describe.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&mdash;<i>The Method of Gradation.</i></p>
<p id="b3c8a6">6. To gather together the cases which resemble
each other, and to separate those which are essentially
distinct, has often been described as the main business
of science; and may, in a certain loose and vague
manner of speaking, pass for a description of some of
the leading procedures in the acquirement of knowledge.
The selection of instances which agree, and of
instances which differ, in some prominent point or
property, are important steps in the formation of
science. But when classes of things and properties
have been established in virtue of such comparisons, it
may still be doubtful whether these classes are separated
by distinctions of opposites, or by differences of
degree. And to settle such questions, the <i>Method of
Gradation</i> is employed; which consists in taking
intermediate stages of the properties in question, so as to
ascertain by experiment whether, in the transition
from one class to another, we have to leap over a
manifest gap, or to follow a continuous road.</p>
<p id="b3c8a7">7. Thus for instance, one of the early <i>Divisions</i>
established by electrical philosophers was that of <i>Electrics</i>
and <i>Conductors</i>. But this division Dr. Faraday
has overturned as an essential opposition. He
takes<a id="fnanchor42-3" href="#note42-3"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> a
<i>Gradation</i> which carries him from Conductors to
Non-conductors. Sulphur, or Lac, he says, are held to be
non-conductors, but are not rigorously so. Spermaceti
is a bad conductor: ice or water better than spermaceti:
metals so much better that they are put in a
different class. But even in metals the transit of the
electricity is not instantaneous: we have in them proof
of a retardation of the electric current: ‘and what <span class="pagenum" id="page225">225</span>
reason,” Mr. Faraday asks, “why this retardation
should not be of the same kind as that in spermaceti,
or in lac, or sulphur? But as, in them, retardation is
insulation, [and insulation is
induction<a id="fnanchor43-3" href="#note43-3"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a>] why should
we refuse the same relation to the same exhibitions of
force in the metals?”</p>

</span> These words refer to another proposition,
also established by the Method of Gradation.
</div>
<p>The process employed by the same sagacious philosopher
to show the <em>identity</em> of Voltaic and Franklinic
electricity, is another example of the same kind<a id="fnanchor44-3" href="#note44-3"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>.
Machine [Franklinic] electricity was made to exhibit the
same phenomena as Voltaic electricity, by causing the
discharge to pass through a bad conductor, into a very
extensive discharging train: and thus it was clearly
shown that Franklinic electricity, not so conducted,
differs from the other kinds, only in being in a state
of successive tension and explosion instead of a state
of continued current.</p>

<p>Again; to show that the decomposition of bodies in
the Voltaic circuit was not due to the <em>Attraction</em> of the
Poles<a id="fnanchor45-3" href="#note45-3"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>,
Mr. Faraday devised a beautiful series of
experiments, in which these supposed <em>Poles</em> were made to
assume all possible electrical conditions:&mdash;in some cases
the decomposition took place against air, which according
to common language is not a conductor, nor is decomposed;&mdash;in
others, against the metallic poles, which
are excellent conductors but undecomposable;&mdash;and so
on: and hence he infers that the decomposition cannot
justly be considered as due to the Attraction, or Attractive
Powers, of the Poles.</p>

<p id="b3c8a8">8. The reader of the <i>Novum Organon</i> may perhaps,
in looking at such examples of the Rule, be reminded
of some of Bacon’s Classes of Instances, as his <i>instantiæ
absentiæ in proximo</i>, and his <i>instantiæ migrantes</i>.
But we may remark that Instances classed
and treated as Bacon recommends in those parts of
his work, could hardly lead to scientific truth. His <span class="pagenum" id="page226">226</span>
processes are vitiated by his proposing to himself the
<em>form</em> or <em>cause</em> of the property before him, as the object
of his inquiry; instead of being content to obtain, in
the first place, the <em>law of phenomena</em>. Thus his
example<a id="fnanchor46-3" href="#note46-3"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a>
of a Migrating Instance is thus given. “Let
the <em>Nature inquired into</em> be that of Whiteness;
an Instance Migrating to the production of this property is
glass, first whole, and then pulverized; or plain water,
and water agitated into a foam; for glass and water
are transparent, and not white; but glass powder and
foam are white, and not transparent. Hence we must
inquire what has happened to the glass or water in
that Migration. For it is plain that the <em>Form of
Whiteness</em> is conveyed and induced by the crushing
of the glass and shaking of the water.” No real
knowledge has resulted from this line of reasoning:&mdash;from
taking the Natures and Forms of things and of
their qualities for the primary subject of our researches.</p>

</span> <i>Nov. Org.</i> lib. ii. Aph. 28.
</div>
<p id="b3c8a9">9. We may easily give examples from other subjects in
which the Method of Gradation has been used
to establish, or to endeavour to establish, very extensive
propositions. Thus Laplace’s Nebular Hypothesis,&mdash;that
systems like our solar system are formed by
gradual condensation from diffused masses, such as the
nebulæ among the stars,&mdash;is founded by him upon an
application of this Method of Gradation. We see, he
conceives, among these nebulæ, instances of all degrees
of condensation, from the most loosely diffused fluid,
to that separation and solidification of parts by which
suns, and satellites, and planets are formed: and thus
we have before us instances of systems in all their
stages; as in a forest we see trees in every period of
growth. How far the examples in this case satisfy the
demands of the Method of Gradation, it remains for
astronomers and philosophers to examine.</p>
<p>Again; this method was used with great success by
Macculloch and others to refute the opinion, put in
currency by the Wernerian school of geologists, that <span class="pagenum" id="page227">227</span>
the rocks called <i>trap rocks</i> must be classed with those
to which a <em>sedimentary</em> origin is ascribed. For it was
shown that a gradual <em>transition</em> might be traced from
those examples in which trap rocks most resembled
stratified rocks, to the lavas which have been recently
ejected from volcanoes: and that it was impossible to
assign a different origin to one portion, and to the
other, of this kind of mineral masses; and as the
volcanic rocks were certainly not sedimentary, it followed,
that the trap rocks were not of that nature.</p>
<p>Again; we have an attempt of a still larger kind
made by Sir C. Lyell, to apply this Method of Gradation
so as to disprove all distinction between the causes by
which geological phenomena have been produced, and
the causes which are now acting at the earth’s surface.
He has collected a very remarkable series of changes
which have taken place, and are still taking place, by
the action of water, volcanoes, earthquakes, and other
terrestrial operations; and he conceives he has shown
in these a <em>gradation</em> which leads, with no wide chasm
or violent leap, to the state of things of which geological
researches have supplied the evidence.</p>
<p id="b3c8a10">10. Of the value of this Method in geological speculations,
no doubt can be entertained. Yet it must still
require a grave and profound consideration, in so vast
an application of the Method as that attempted by
Sir C. Lyell, to determine what extent we may allow to
the steps of our <em>gradation</em>; and to decide how far the
changes which have taken place in distant parts of the
series may exceed those of which we have historical
knowledge, without ceasing to be of the <em>same kind</em>.
Those who, dwelling in a city, see, from time to time,
one house built and another pulled down, may say that
such <em>existing causes</em>, operating through past time,
sufficiently explain the existing condition of the city. Yet
we arrive at important political and historical truths,
by considering the <em>origin</em> of a city as an event of a
<em>different order</em> from those daily changes. The causes
which are now working to produce geological results,
may be supposed to have been, at some former epoch,
so far exaggerated in their operation, that the changes <span class="pagenum" id="page228">228</span>
should be paroxysms, not degrees;&mdash;that they should
violate, not continue, the gradual series. And we
have no kind of evidence whether the duration of our
historical times is sufficient to give us a just measure
of the limits of such degrees;&mdash;whether the terms
which we have under our notice enable us to ascertain
the average rate of progression.</p>
<p id="b3c8a11">11. The result of such considerations seems to be
this:&mdash;that we may apply the Method of Gradation in
the investigation of geological causes, provided we
leave the Limits of the Gradation undefined. But,
then, this is equivalent to the admission of the opposite
hypothesis: for a continuity of which the successive
intervals are not limited, is not distinguishable from
discontinuity. The geological sects of recent times
have been distinguished as <i>uniformitarians</i> and <i>catastrophists</i>:
the Method of Gradation seems to prove the
doctrine of the uniformitarians; but then, at the same
time that it does this, it breaks down the distinction
between them and the catastrophists.</p>
<p class="end">There are other exemplifications of the use of gradations
in Science which well deserve notice: but some
of them are of a kind somewhat different, and may be
considered under a separate head.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III. <i>The Method of Natural Classification.</i></p>
<p id="b3c8a12">12. The Method of Natural Classification consists, as
we have seen, in grouping together objects, not according
to any selected properties, but according to their
most important resemblances; and in combining such
grouping with the assignation of certain marks of the
classes thus formed. The examples of the successful
application of this method are to be found in the
Classificatory Sciences through their whole extent; as,
for example, in framing the Genera of plants and animals.
The same method, however, may often be extended to other
sciences. Thus the classification of
Crystalline Forms, according to their Degree of Symmetry,
(which is really an important distinction,) as introduced
by Mohs and Weiss, was a great improvement <span class="pagenum" id="page229">229</span>
upon Haüy’s arbitrary division according to certain
assumed primary forms. Sir David Brewster was led
to the same distinction of crystals by the study of
their optical properties; and the scientific value of the
classification was thus strongly exhibited. Mr. Howard’s
classification of Clouds appears to be founded in
their real nature, since it enables him to express the
laws of their changes and successions. As we have
elsewhere said, the criterion of a true classification is,
that it makes general propositions possible. One of
the most prominent examples of the beneficial influence
of a right classification, is to be seen in the
impulse given to geology by the distinction of strata
according to the organic fossils which they
contain<a id="fnanchor47-3" href="#note47-3"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a>:
which, ever since its general adoption, has been a
leading principle in the speculations of geologists.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-3" href="#fnanchor47-3">47</a>
</span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. ii. sect. 3.
</div>
<p id="b3c8a13">13. The mode in which, in this and in other cases,
the Method of Natural Classification directs the researches
of the philosopher, is this:&mdash;his arrangement
being adopted, at least as an instrument of inquiry and
trial, he follows the course of the different members of
the classification, according to the guidance which Nature
herself offers; not prescribing beforehand the
marks of each part, but distributing the facts according
to the total resemblances, or according to those
resemblances which he finds to be most important.
Thus, in tracing the course of a series of strata from
place to place, we identify each stratum, not by any
single character, but by all taken together;&mdash;texture,
colour, fossils, position, and any other circumstances
which offer themselves. And if, by this means, we
come to ambiguous cases, where different indications
appear to point different ways, we decide so as best to
preserve undamaged those general relations and truths
which constitute the value of our system. Thus
although we consider the organic fossils in each stratum
as its most important characteristic, we are not
prevented, by the disappearance of some fossils, or the
addition of others, or by the total absence of fossils, <span class="pagenum" id="page230">230</span>
from identifying strata in distant countries, if the
position and other circumstances authorize us to do so.
And by this Method of Classification, the doctrine of
<i>Geological Equivalents</i><a id="fnanchor48-3" href="#note48-3"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a>
has been applied to a great
part of Europe.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-3" href="#fnanchor48-3">48</a>
</span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. iii. sect. 4.
</div>
<p id="b3c8a14">14. We may further observe, that the same method
of natural classification which thus enables us to
identify strata in remote situations, notwithstanding that
there may be great differences in their material and
contents, also forbids us to assume the identity of the
series of rocks which occur in different countries, when
this identity has not been verified by such a continuous
exploration of the component members of the
series. It would be in the highest degree unphilosophical
to apply the special names of the English or
German strata to the rocks of India, or America, or
even of southern Europe, till it has appeared that in
those countries the geological series of northern Europe
really exists. In each separate country, the divisions
of the formations which compose the crust of the
earth must be made out, by applying the Method of
Natural Arrangement <em>to that particular case</em>, and not
by arbitrarily extending to it the nomenclature
belonging to another case. It is only by such precautions,
that we can ever succeed in obtaining geological
propositions, at the same time true and comprehensive; or
can obtain any sound general views respecting the
physical history of the earth.</p>
<p id="b3c8a15">15. The Method of Natural Classification, which
we thus recommend, falls in with those mental habits
which we formerly described as resulting from the
study of Natural History. The method was then termed
the <i>Method of Type</i>, and was put in opposition to the
<i>Method of Definition</i>.</p>
<p>The Method of Natural Classification is directly
opposed to the process in which we assume and apply
<em>arbitrary</em> definitions; for in the former Method, we
find our classes in nature, and do not make them by
marks of our own imposition. Nor can any advantage <span class="pagenum" id="page231">231</span>
to the progress of knowledge be procured, by laying
down our characters when our arrangements are as yet
quite loose and unformed. Nothing was gained by
the attempts to <em>define</em> Metals by their weight, their
hardness, their ductility, their colour; for to all these
marks, as fast as they were proposed, exceptions were
found, among bodies which still could not be excluded
from the list of Metals. It was only when
elementary substances were divided into <em>Natural
Classes</em>, of which classes Metals were one, that a true
view of their distinctive characters was obtained.
Definitions in the outset of our examination of nature are
almost always, not only useless, but prejudicial.</p>
<p id="b3c8a16">16. When we obtain a Law of Nature by induction
from phenomena, it commonly happens, as we have
already seen, that we introduce, at the same time, a
Proposition and a Definition. In this case, the two
are correlative, each giving a real value to the other.
In such cases, also, the Definition, as well as the
Proposition, may become the basis of rigorous reasoning,
and may lead to a series of deductive truths. We have
examples of such Definitions and Propositions in the
Laws of Motion, and in many other cases.</p>
<p id="b3c8a17">17. When we have established Natural Classes of
objects, we seek for Characters of our classes; and
these Characters may, to a certain extent, be called the
<i>Definitions</i> of our classes. This is to be understood,
however, only in a limited sense: for these Definitions
are not absolute and permanent. They are liable to
be modified and superseded. If we find a case which
manifestly belongs to our Natural Class, though violating
our Definition, we do not shut out the case, but
alter our definition. Thus, when we have made it
part of our Definition of the <i>Rose</i> family, that they
have <i>alternate stipulate leaves</i>, we do not, therefore,
exclude from the family the genus <i>Lowæa</i>, which has
<em>no stipulæ</em>. In Natural Classifications, our
Definitions are to be considered as temporary and
provisional only. When Sir C. Lyell established the
distinctions of the tertiary strata, which he termed <i>Eocene</i>,
<i>Miocene</i>, and <i>Pliocene</i>, he took a numerical criterion <span class="pagenum" id="page232">232</span>
(the proportion of recent species of shells contained in
those strata) as the basis of his division. But now
that those kinds of strata have become, by their
application to a great variety of cases, a series of Natural
Classes, we must, in our researches, keep in view the
natural connexion of the formations themselves in different
places; and must by no means allow ourselves
to be governed by the numerical proportions which
were originally contemplated; or even by any amended
numerical criterion equally arbitrary; for however
amended, Definitions in natural history are never immortal.
The etymologies of <i>Pliocene</i> and <i>Miocene</i>
may, hereafter, come to have merely an historical interest;
and such a state of things will be no more inconvenient,
provided the natural connexions of each class
are retained, than it is to call a rock <i>oolite</i> or
<i>porphyry</i>, when it has no roelike structure and no fiery
spots.</p>
<p class="end">The Methods of Induction which are treated of in
this and the preceding chapter, and which are specially
applicable to causes governed by relations of Quantity
or of Resemblance, commonly lead us to <i>Laws of Phenomena</i>
only. Inductions founded upon other ideas,
those of Substance and Cause for example, appear to
conduct us somewhat further into a knowledge of the
essential nature and real connexions of things. But
before we speak of these, we shall say a few words
respecting the way in which inductive propositions,
once obtained, may be verified and carried into effect
by their application.</p>

application of inductive truths, we here
mean, according to the arrangement given in
chap. I. of this book, those steps, which in the natural
order of science, follow the discovery of each truth.
These steps are, the <em>verification</em> of the discovery by additional
experiments and reasonings, and its <em>extension</em>
to new cases, not contemplated by the original discoverer.
These processes occupy that period, which,
in the history of each great discovery, we have termed
the <i>Sequel</i> of the epoch; as the collection of facts, and
the elucidation of conceptions, form its Prelude.</p>
<p id="b3c9a2">2. It is not necessary to dwell at length on the
processes of the Verification of Discoveries. When the
Law of Nature is once stated, it is far easier to devise
and execute experiments which prove it, than it was
to discern the evidence before. The truth becomes
one of the standard doctrines of the science to which it
belongs, and is verified by all who study or who teach
the science experimentally. The leading doctrines of
Chemistry are constantly exemplified by each chemist
in his <i>Laboratory</i>; and an amount of verification is
thus obtained of which books give no adequate conception.
In Astronomy, we have a still stronger example
of the process of verifying discoveries. Ever since the
science assumed a systematic form, there have been
<i>Observatories</i>, in which the consequences of the theory
were habitually compared with the results of observation.
And to facilitate this comparison, <i>Tables</i> of
great extent have been calculated, with immense labour,
from each theory, showing the place which the <span class="pagenum" id="page235">235</span>
theory assigned to the heavenly bodies at successive
times; and thus, as it were, challenging nature to
deny the truth of the discovery. In this way, as I
have elsewhere stated, the continued prevalence of an
errour in the systematic parts of astronomy is
impossible<a id="fnanchor49-3" href="#note49-3"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a>.
An errour, if it arise, makes its way into the
tables, into the ephemeris, into the observer’s nightly
list, or his sheet of reductions; the evidence of sense
flies in its face in a thousand Observatories; the
discrepancy is traced to its source, and soon disappears
for ever.</p>

</span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vii. c. vi. sect. 6.
</div>
<p id="b3c9a3">3. In these last expressions, we suppose the theory,
not only to be tested, but also to be <em>corrected</em> when it
is found to be imperfect. And this also is part of the
business of the observing astronomer. From his accumulated
observations, he deduces more exact values than
had previously been obtained, of the <i>Constants</i> or
<i>Coefficients</i> of these Inequalities of which the <i>Argument</i> is
already known. This he is enabled to do by the methods
explained in the <a href="#page186">fifth</a> chapter of this book; the <a href="#b3c7a7">Method
of Means</a>, and especially the <a href="#b3c7a13">Method of Least Squares</a>.
In other cases, he finds, by the <a href="#b3c7a15">Method of Residues</a>,
some new Inequality; for if no change of the Coefficients
will bring the Tables and the observation to a
coincidence, he knows that a new Term is wanting in
his formula. He obtains, as far as he can, the law of
this unknown Term; and when its existence and its
law have been fully established, there remains the
task of tracing it to its cause.</p>
<p id="b3c9a4">4. The condition of the science of Astronomy, with
regard to its security and prospect of progress, is one of
singular felicity. It is a question well worth our consideration,
as regarding the interests of science, whether, in other branches
of knowledge also, <i>a continued
and corrected system, of observation and calculation</i>,
imitating the system employed by astronomers, might
not be adopted. But the discussion of this question
would involve us in a digression too wide for the present occasion. <span class="pagenum" id="page236">236</span></p>
<p id="b3c9a5">5. There is another mode of application of true
theories after their discovery, of which we must also
speak; I mean the process of showing that facts, not
included in the original induction, and apparently of a
different kind, are explained by reasonings founded
upon the theory:&mdash;<i>extensions</i> of the theory as we may
call them. The history of physical astronomy is full
of such events. Thus after Bradley and Wargentin
had observed a certain cycle among the perturbations
of Jupiter’s satellites, Laplace explained this cycle by
the doctrine of universal
gravitation<a id="fnanchor50-3" href="#note50-3"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a>. The long
inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, the diminution of the
obliquity of the ecliptic, the acceleration of the moon’s
mean motion, were in like manner accounted for by
Laplace. The coincidence of the nodes of the moon’s
equator with those of her orbit was proved to result
from mechanical principles by Lagrange. The motions
of the recently-discovered planets, and of comets, shown
by various mathematicians to be in exact accordance
with the theory, are Verifications and Extensions still
more obvious.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-3" href="#fnanchor50-3">50</a>
</span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vii. c. iv. sect. 3.
</div>
<p id="b3c9a6">6. In many of the cases just noticed, the consistency
between the theory, and the consequences thus proved
to result from it, is so far from being evident, that the
most consummate command of all the powers and aids
of mathematical reasoning is needed, to enable the philosopher
to arrive at the result. In consequence of
this circumstance, the labours just referred to, of Laplace,
Lagrange, and others, have been the object of
very great and very just admiration. Moreover, the
necessary connexion of new facts, at first deemed inexplicable,
with principles already known to be true;&mdash;a
connexion utterly invisible at the outset, and yet at
last established with the certainty of demonstration;&mdash;strikes
us with the delight of a new discovery; and at
first sight appears no less admirable than an original
induction. Accordingly, men sometimes appear tempted
to consider Laplace and other great mathematicians as
persons of a kindred genius to Newton. We must not <span class="pagenum" id="page237">237</span>
forget, however, that there is a great and essential difference
between inductive and deductive processes of
the mind. The discovery of a <em>new</em> theory, which is
true, is a step widely distinct from any mere development
of the consequences of a theory already invented
and established.</p>
<p id="b3c9a7">7. In the other sciences also, which have been
framed by a study of natural phenomena, we may find
examples of the explanation of new phenomena by
applying the principles of the science when once
established. Thus, when the laws of the reflection
and refraction of light had been established, a new
and poignant exemplification of them was found in
the explanation of the Rainbow by the reflection and
refraction of light in the spherical drops of a shower;
and again, another, no less striking, when the intersecting
Luminous Circles and Mock Suns, which are
seen in cold seasons, were completely explained by the
hexagonal crystals of ice which float in the upper
regions of the atmosphere. The Darkness of the space
between the primary and secondary rainbow is another
appearance which optical theory completely explains.
And when we further include in our optical theory
the doctrine of interferences, we find the explanation
of other phenomena; for instance, the Supernumerary
Rainbows which accompany the primary rainbow on
its inner side, and the small Halos which often surround
the sun and moon. And when we come to
optical experiments, we find many instances in which
the doctrine of interferences and of undulations have
been applied to explain the phenomena by calculations
almost as complex as those which we have mentioned
in speaking of astronomy: with results as little foreseen
at first and as entirely satisfactory in the end.
Such are Schwerdt’s explanation of the diffracted
images of a triangular aperture by the doctrine of
interferences, and the explanation of the coloured
Lemniscates seen by polarized light in biaxal crystals,
given by Young and by Herschel: and still more
marked is another case, in which the curves are
unsymmetrical, namely, the curves seen by passing polarized <span class="pagenum" id="page238">238</span>
light through plates of quartz, which agree in a wonderful manner
with the calculations of Airy. To these
we may add the curious phenomena, and equally
curious mathematical explanation, of Conical Refraction,
as brought to view by Professor Lloyd and Sir
W. Hamilton. Indeed, the whole history both of
Physical Optics and of Physical Astronomy is a series
of <em>felicities</em> of this kind, as we have elsewhere
observed. Such applications of theory, and unforeseen
explanations of new facts by complicated trains of reasoning
necessarily flowing from the theory, are strong proof
of the truth of the theory, while it is in the course of
being established; but we are here rather speaking of
them as applications of the theory after it has been
established.</p>
<p>Those who thus apply principles already discovered
are not to be ranked in their intellectual achievements
with those who discover new principles; but still,
when such applications are masked by the complex
relations of space and number, it is impossible not to
regard with admiration the clearness and activity of
intellect which thus discerns in a remote region the
rays of a central truth already unveiled by some great
discoverer.</p>
<p id="b3c9a8">8. As examples in other fields of the application
of a scientific discovery to the explanation of natural
phenomena, we may take the identification of Lightning
with electricity by Franklin, and the explanation
of Dew by Wells. For Wells’s <i>Inquiry into the
Cause of Dew</i>, though it has sometimes been praised
as an original discovery, was, in fact, only resolving
the phenomenon into principles already discovered.
The atmologists of the last century were
aware<a id="fnanchor51-3" href="#note51-3"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a> that
the vapour which exists in air in an invisible state
may be condensed into water by cold; and they had
noticed that there is always a certain temperature,
lower than that of the atmosphere, to which if we
depress bodies, water forms upon them in fine drops.
This temperature is the limit of that which
is <span class="pagenum" id="page239">239</span> necessary
to constitute vapour, and is hence called the <i>constituent
temperature</i>. But these principles were not
generally familiar in England till Dr. Wells introduced
them into his <i>Essay on Dew</i>, published in 1814; having
indeed been in a great measure led to them by his
own experiments and reasonings. His explanation of
Dew,&mdash;that it arises from the coldness of the bodies
on which it settles,&mdash;was established with great ingenuity;
and is a very elegant confirmation of the Theory
of Constituent Temperature.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-3" href="#fnanchor51-3">51</a>
</span><i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. x. c. iii. sect. 5.
</div>
<p>9. As other examples of such explanations of new
phenomena by a theory, we may point out Ampère’s
Theory that Magnetism is transverse voltaic currents,
applied to explain the rotation of a voltaic wire round
a magnet, and of a magnet round a voltaic wire. And
again, in the same subject, when it had been proved
that electricity might be converted into magnetism, it
seemed certain that magnetism might be converted
into electricity; and accordingly Faraday found under
what conditions this may be done; though indeed
here, the theory rather suggested the experiment than
explained it when it had been independently observed.
The production of an electric spark by a magnet was
a very striking exemplification of the theory of the
identity of these different polar agencies.</p>
<p>10. In Chemistry such applications of the principles of
the science are very frequent; for it is the
chemist’s business to account for the innumerable
changes which take place in material substances by
the effects of mixture, heat, and the like. As a marked
instance of such an application of the science, we
may take the explanation of the explosive force of
gunpowder<a id="fnanchor52-3" href="#note52-3"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a>,
from the conversion of its materials
into gases. In Mineralogy also we have to apply the <span class="pagenum" id="page240">240</span>
principles of Chemistry to the analysis of bodies: and
I may mention, as a case which at the time excited
much notice, the analysis of a mineral called Heavy
Spar. It was found that different specimens of this
mineral differed in their crystalline angles about three
degrees and a half; a difference which was at variance
with the mineralogical discovery then recently made,
of the constancy of the angle of the same substance.
Vauquelin solved this difficulty by discovering that
the crystals with the different angles were really
minerals chemically different; the one kind being sulphate
of barytes, and the other, sulphate of strontian.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-3" href="#fnanchor52-3">52</a>
</span> The explanation is, that the force is due to the
sudden development of a large volume of nitrogen and carbonic
acid gases, which at the ordinary temperature of the air would
occupy a space equal to about 300 times the bulk of the powder
used, but from the intense heat developed at the moment of the
explosion, the dilatation amounts to at least 1500 times
the volume of the gunpowder employed.
</div>
<p>11. In this way a scientific theory, when once established,
is perpetually finding new applications in the
phenomena of nature; and those who make such
applications, though, as we have said, they care not to
be ranked with the great discoverers who establish
theories new and true, often receive a more prompt
and general applause than great discoverers do; because
they have not to struggle with the perplexity
and averseness which often encounter the promulgation
of new truths.</p>
<p>12. Along with the verification and extension of
scientific truths, we are naturally led to consider the
useful application of them. The example of all the
best writers who have previously treated of the philosophy
of sciences, from Bacon to Herschel, draws our
attention to those instances of the application of scientific
truths, which are subservient to the uses of
practical life; to the support, the safety, the pleasure
of man. It is well known in how large a degree
the furtherance of these objects constituted the merit
of the <i>Novum Organon</i> in the eyes of its author;
and the enthusiasm with which men regard these
visible and tangible manifestations of the power and
advantage which knowledge may bring, has gone on
increasing up to our own day. And undoubtedly such
applications of the discoveries of science to promote
the preservation, comfort, power and dignity of man,
must always be objects of great philosophical as well
as practical interest. Yet we may observe that those <span class="pagenum" id="page241">241</span>
practical inventions which are of most importance in
the Arts, have not commonly, in the past ages of the
world, been the results of theoretical knowledge, nor
have they tended very greatly to the promotion of such
knowledge. The use of bread and of wine has existed
from the first beginning of man’s social history; yet men
have not had&mdash;we may question whether they yet have&mdash;a
satisfactory theory of the constitution and fabrication
of bread and of wine. From a very early period
there have been workers in metal: yet who could tell
upon what principles depended the purifying of gold
and silver by the fire, or the difference between iron
and steel? In some cases, as in the story of the brass
produced by the Corinthian conflagration, some particular
step in art is ascribed to a special accident; but
hardly ever to the thoughtful activity of a scientific
speculator. The Dyeing of cloths, the fabrication and
colouring of earthenware and glass vessels was carried
to a very high degree of completeness; yet who had
any sound theoretical knowledge respecting these processes?
Are not all these arts still practised with
a degree of skill which we can hardly or not at all
surpass, by nations which have, properly speaking, no
science? Till lately, at least, if even now the case
be different, the operations by which man’s comforts,
luxuries, and instruments were produced, were either
mere practical processes, which the artist practises, but
which the scientist cannot account for; or, as in astronomy
and optics, they depended upon a small portion
only of the theoretical sciences, and did not tend to
illustrate, or lead to, any larger truths. Bacon mentions
as recent discoveries, which gave him courage
and hope with regard to the future progress of human
knowledge, the invention of gunpowder, glass, and
printing, the introduction of silk, and the discovery of
America. Yet which of these can be said to have been
the results of a theoretical enlargement of human
knowledge? except perhaps the discovery of the New
World, which was in some degree the result of Columbus’s
conviction of the globular form of the earth.
This, however, was not a recent, but a very ancient <span class="pagenum" id="page242">242</span>
doctrine of all sound astronomers. And which of these
discoveries has been the cause of a great enlargement
of our theoretical knowledge?&mdash;except any one claims
such a merit for the discovery of printing; in which
sense the result is brought about in a very indirect
manner, in the same way in which the progress of
freedom and of religion may be ascribed as consequences
to the same discovery. However great or
striking, then, such discoveries have been, they have
not, generally speaking, produced any marked advance
of the Inductive Sciences in the sense in which we
here speak of them. They have increased man’s
power, it may be: that is, his power of adding to his
comforts and communicating with his fellow-men.
But they have not necessarily or generally increased
his theoretical knowledge. And, therefore, with whatever
admiration we may look upon such discoveries as
these, we are not to admire them as steps in Inductive
Science.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, we are not to ask of Inductive Science,
as a necessary result of her progress,
such additions as these to man’s means of enjoyment
and action. It is said, with a feeling of triumph, that
Knowledge is Power: but in whatever sense this may
truly be said, we value Knowledge, not because it is
Power but because it is Knowledge; and we estimate
wrongly both the nature and the dignity of that kind
of science with which we are here concerned, if we
expect that every new advance in theory will forthwith
have a market value:&mdash;that science will mark
the birth of a new Truth with some new birthday
present, such as a softer stuff to wrap our limbs, a
brighter vessel to grace our table, a new mode of
communication with our friends and the world, a new
instrument for the destruction of our enemies, or a new
region which may be the source of wealth and interest.</p>
<p>13. Yet though, as we have said, many of the most
remarkable processes which we reckon as the triumphs
of Art did not result from a previous progress of Science,
we have, at many points of the history of Science,
applications of new views, to enable man to <em>do</em>
as well <span class="pagenum" id="page243">243</span>
as to <em>see</em>. When Archimedes had obtained clear views
of the theory of machines, he forthwith expressed them
in his bold practical boast; ‘Give me whereon to stand,
and I will move the earth.’ And his machines with
which he is said to have handled the Roman ships
like toys, and his burning mirrors with which he is
reported to have set them on fire, are at least possible
applications of theoretical principles. When he saw
the waters rising in the bath as his body descended,
and rushed out crying, ‘I have found the way;’ what
he had found was the solution of the practical
question of the quantity of silver mixed with the gold of
Hiero’s crown. But the mechanical inventions of Hero
of Alexandria, which moved by the force of air or of
steam, probably involved no exact theoretical notions
of the properties of air or of steam. He devised a toy
which revolved by the action of steam; but by the force
of steam exerted in issuing from an orifice, not by its
pressure or condensation. And the Romans had no arts
derived from science in addition to those which they
inherited from the Greeks. They built aqueducts, not
indeed through ignorance of the principles of hydrostatics,
as has sometimes been said; for we, who know our
hydrostatics, build aqueducts still; but their practice
exemplified only Archimedean hydrostatics. Their
clepsydras or water-clocks were adjusted by trial only.
They used arches and vaults more copiously than the
Greeks had done, but the principle of the arch appears,
by the most recent researches, to have been known to
the Greeks. Domes and groined arches, such as we have
in the Pantheon and in the Baths of Caracalla, perhaps
they invented; certainly they practised them on
a noble scale. Yet this was rather practical skill
than theoretical knowledge; and it was pursued by
their successors in the middle ages in the same manner,
as practical skill rather than theoretical knowledge.
Thus were produced flying buttresses, intersecting
pointed vaults, and the other wonders of mediæval
architecture. The engineers of the fifteenth century,
as Leonardo da Vinci, began to convert their practical
into theoretical knowledge of Mechanics; but still <span class="pagenum" id="page244">244</span>
clocks and watches, flying machines and printing
presses involved no new mechanical principle.</p>
<p>14. But from this time the advances in Science
generally produced, as their result, new inventions of
a practical kind. Thus the doctrine of the weight of
air led to such inventions as the barometer used as
a Weather-glass, the Air-pump with its train of curious
experiments, the Diving-Bell, the Balloon. The
telescope was perhaps in some degree a discovery due
to accident, but its principles had been taught by
Roger Bacon, and still more clearly by Descartes.
Newton invented a steady thermometer by attending
to steady laws of nature. And in the case of the improvements
of the steam engine made by Watt, we
have an admirable example how superior the method
of improving Art by Science is, to the blind gropings
of mere practical habit.</p>
<p>Of this truth, the history of most of the useful arts
in our time offers abundant proofs and illustrations.
All improvements and applications of the forces and
agencies which man employs for his purposes are now
commonly made, not by blind trial but with the
clearest theoretical as well as practical insight which
he can obtain, into the properties of the agents which
he employs. In this way he has constructed, (using
theory and calculation at every step of his construction,)
steam engines, steam boats, screw-propellers,
locomotive engines, railroads and bridges and structures
of all kinds. Lightning-conductors have been
improved and applied to the preservation of buildings,
and especially of ships, with admirable effect, by Sir
Wm. Snow Harris, an experimenter who has studied
with great care the theory of electricity. The measurement
of the quantity of oxygen, that is, of vital
power, in air, has been taught by Cavendish, and by
Dr Ure a skilful chemist of our time. Methods for
measuring the bleaching power of a substance have
been devised by eminent chemical philosophers, Gay
Lussac and Mr Graham. Davy used his discoveries
concerning the laws of flame in order to construct his
Safety Lamp:&mdash;his discoveries concerning the galvanic <span class="pagenum" id="page245">245</span>
battery in order to protect ships’ bottoms from corrosion.
The skilled geologist has repeatedly given to
those who were about to dig for coal where it could
have no geological place, advice which has saved them
from ruinous expence. Sir Roderick Murchison, from
geological evidence, declared the likelihood of gold
being found abundantly in Australia, many years before
the diggings began.</p>
<p>Even the subtle properties of light as shewn in the
recent discoveries of its interference and polarization,
have been applied to useful purposes. Young invented
an <i>Eriometer</i>, an instrument which should measure the
fineness of the threads of wool by the coloured fringes
which they produce; and substances which it is important
to distinguish in the manufacture of sugar,
are discriminated by their effect in rotating the plane
of polarization of light. One substance has been termed
<i>Dextrin</i>, from its impressing a right-handed rotation
on the plane of polarization.</p>
<p>And in a great number of Arts and Manufactures,
the necessity of a knowledge of theory to the right
conduct of practice is familiarly acknowledged and
assumed. In the testing and smelting of metals, in the
fabrication of soap, of candles, of sugar; in the dyeing
and printing of woollen, linen, cotton and silken stuffs;
the master manufacturer has always the scientific chemist
at his elbow;&mdash;either a ‘consulting chemist’ to
whom he may apply on a special occasion, (for such is
now a regular profession;) or a chemist who day by
day superintends, controls, and improves the processes
which his workmen daily carry on. In these cases,
though Art long preceded Science, Science now guides,
governs and advances Art.</p>
<p>15. Other Arts and manufactures which have arisen
in modern times have been new creations produced by
Science, and requiring a complete acquaintance with
scientific processes to conduct them effectually and
securely. Such are the photographic Arts, now so
various in their form; beginning with those which,
from their authors, are called Daguerrotype and Talbotype.
Such are the Arts of Electrotype modelling <span class="pagenum" id="page246">246</span>
and Electrotype plating. Such are the Arts of preparing
fulminating substances; gun-cotton; fulminate
of silver, and of mercury; and the application of those
Arts to use, in the fabrication of percussion-caps for
guns. Such is the Art of Electric Telegraphy, from its
first beginning to its last great attempt, the electric
cord which connects England and America. Such is
the Art of imitating by the chemistry of the laboratory
the vegetable chemistry of nature, and thus producing
the flavour of the pear, the apple, the pine-apple, the
melon, the quince. Such is the Art of producing in
man a temporary insensibility to pain, which was
effected first through the means of sulphuric ether by
Dr Jackson of America, and afterwards through the
use of chloroform by Dr Simpson of Edinburgh. In
these cases and many others Science has endowed
man with New Arts. And though even in these Arts,
which are thus the last results of Science, there is
much which Science cannot fully understand and explain;
still, such cases cannot but be looked upon as
notable verifications of the anticipations of those who
in former times expected from the progress of Science
a harvest of material advantages to man.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E
formerly<a id="fnanchor53-3" href="#note53-3"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a>
stated the objects of the researches
of Science to be Laws of Phenomena and
Causes; and showed the propriety and the necessity of
not resting in the former object, but extending our <span class="pagenum" id="page248">248</span>
inquiries to the latter also. Inductions, in which phenomena
are connected by relations of Space, Time,
Number and Resemblance, belong to the former class;
and of the Methods applicable to such Inductions we
have treated already. In proceeding to Inductions
governed by any ulterior Ideas, we can no longer lay
down any Special Methods by which our procedure
may be directed. A few general remarks are all that
we shall offer.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-3" href="#fnanchor53-3">53</a>
</span> <a href="#page118">B. ii. c. vii.</a>
</div>
<p>The principal Maxim in such cases of Induction is
the obvious one:&mdash;that we must be careful to possess
and to apply, with perfect clearness and precision, the
Fundamental Idea on which the Induction depends.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this in a few cases.</p>
<p id="b3c10a2">2. <i>Induction of Substance.</i>&mdash;The
Idea of Substance<a id="fnanchor54-3" href="#note54-3"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a>
involves this axiom, that the weight of the whole compound
must be equal to the weights of the separate
elements, whatever changes the composition or separation
of the elements may have occasioned. The application
of this Maxim we may term the <i>Method of the
Balance</i>. We have seen<a id="fnanchor55-3" href="#note55-3"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a>
elsewhere how the memorable
revolution in Chemistry, the overthrow of Phlogiston,
and the establishment of the Oxygen Theory,
was produced by the application of this Method. We
have seen too<a id="fnanchor56-3" href="#note56-3"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a>
that the same Idea leads us to this
Maxim;&mdash;that <i>Imponderable Fluids</i> are not to be
admitted as <em>chemical</em> elements of bodies.</p>

<p>Whether those which have been termed <i>Imponderable
Fluids</i>,&mdash;the supposed fluids which produce the
phenomena of Light, Heat, Electricity, Galvanism,
Magnetism,&mdash;really exist or no, is a question, not
merely of the <em>Laws</em>, but of the <em>Causes</em> of Phenomena.
It is, as has already been shown, a question which we
cannot help discussing, but which is at present involved
in great obscurity. Nor does it appear at all likely that
we shall obtain a true view of the cause of Light,
Heat, and Electricity, till we have discovered precise
and general laws connecting optical, thermotical, and <span class="pagenum" id="page249">249</span>
electrical <em>phenomena</em> with those chemical doctrines to
which the Idea of Substance is necessarily applied.</p>
<p id="b3c10a3">3. <i>Induction of Force.</i>&mdash;The inference of <i>Mechanical
Forces</i> from phenomena has been so abundantly
practised, that it is perfectly familiar among scientific
inquirers. From the time of Newton, it has been the
most common aim of mathematicians; and a persuasion
has grown up among them, that mechanical forces,&mdash;attraction
and repulsion,&mdash;are the only modes of
action of the particles of bodies which we shall ultimately
have to consider. I have attempted to show
that this mode of conception is inadequate to the purposes
of sound philosophy;&mdash;that the Particles of
crystals, and the Elements of chemical compounds,
must be supposed to be combined in some other way
than by mere mechanical attraction and repulsion.
Dr. Faraday has gone further in shaking the usual
conceptions of the force exerted, in well-known cases.
Among the most noted and conspicuous instances of
attraction and repulsion exerted at a distance, were
those which take place between electrized bodies. But
the eminent electrician just mentioned has endeavoured
to establish, by experiments of which it is very difficult
to elude the weight, that the action in these cases
does not take place at a distance, but is the result of
a chain of intermediate particles connected at every
point by forces of another kind.</p>
<p id="b3c10a4">4. <i>Induction of Polarity.</i>&mdash;The forces to which
Dr. Faraday ascribes the action in these cases are
<i>Polar Forces</i><a id="fnanchor57-3" href="#note57-3"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a>.
We have already endeavoured
to explain the Idea of Polar Forces; which
implies<a id="fnanchor58-3" href="#note58-3"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a> that at
every point forces exactly equal act in opposite directions;
and thus, in the greater part of their course,
neutralize and conceal each other; while at the extremities
of the line, being by some cause liberated, they
are manifested, still equal and opposite. And the
criterion by which this polar character of forces is
recognized, is implied in the reasoning of Faraday, on
the question of one or two electricities, of which we <span class="pagenum" id="page250">250</span>
formerly spoke<a id="fnanchor59-3" href="#note59-3"><span class="fnanchor">59</span></a>.
The maxim is this:&mdash;that in the
action of polar forces, along with every manifestation
of force or property, there exists a corresponding and
simultaneous manifestation of an equal and opposite
force or property.</p>

<p id="b3c10a5">5. As it was the habit of the last age to reduce all
action to mechanical forces, the present race of physical
speculators appears inclined to reduce all forces to
polar forces. Mosotti has endeavoured to show that the
positive and negative electricities pervade all bodies,
and that gravity is only an apparent excess of one of
the kinds over the other. As we have seen, Faraday
has given strong experimental grounds for believing
that the supposed remote actions of electrized bodies
are really the effects of polar forces among contiguous
particles. If this doctrine were established with regard
to all electrical, magnetical, and chemical forces,
we might ask, whether, while all other forces are
polar, gravity really affords a single exception to the
universal rule? Is not the universe pervaded by an
omnipresent antagonism, a fundamental conjunction of
contraries, everywhere opposite, nowhere independent?
We are, as yet, far from the position in which Inductive
Science can enable us to answer such inquiries.</p>
<p id="b3c10a6">6. <i>Induction of Ulterior Causes.</i>&mdash;The first Induction
of a Cause does not close the business of scientific
inquiry. Behind proximate causes, there are ulterior
causes, perhaps a succession of such. Gravity is the
cause of the motions of the planets; but what is the
cause of gravity? This is a question which has occupied
men’s minds from the time of Newton to the present day.
Earthquakes and volcanoes are the causes
of many geological phenomena; but what is the cause
of those subterraneous operations? This inquiry after
ulterior causes is an inevitable result from the intellectual
constitution of man. He discovers mechanical
causes, but he cannot rest in them. He must needs
ask, whence it is that matter has its universal power of
attracting matter. He discovers polar forces: but even <span class="pagenum" id="page251">251</span>
if these be universal, he still desires a further insight
into the cause of this polarity. He sees, in organic
structures, convincing marks of adaptation to an end:
whence, he asks, is this adaptation? He traces in the
history of the earth a chain of causes and effects
operating through time: but what, he inquires, is the
power which holds the end of this chain?</p>
<p>Thus we are referred back from step to step in the
order of causation, in the same, manner as, in the palætiological
sciences, we were referred back in the order
of time. We make discovery after discovery in the
various regions of science; each, it may be, satisfactory,
and in itself complete, but none final. Something
always remains undone. The last question answered,
the answer suggests still another question. The strain
of music from the lyre of Science flows on, rich and
sweet, full and harmonious, but never reaches a close:
no cadence is heard with which the intellectual ear can
feel satisfied.</p>
<p id="b3c10a7"><i>Of the Supreme Cause.</i>&mdash;In the utterance of Science,
no cadence is heard with which the human mind can
feel satisfied. Yet we cannot but go on listening for
and expecting a satisfactory close. The notion of a
cadence appears to be essential to our relish of the
music. The idea of some closing strain seems to lurk
among our own thoughts, waiting to be articulated in
the notes which flow from the knowledge of external
nature. The idea of something ultimate in our philosophical
researches, something in which the mind can
acquiesce, and which will leave us no further questions
to ask, of <em>whence</em>, and <em>why</em>, and <em>by what power</em>, seems
as if it belongs to us:&mdash;as if we could not have it
withheld from us by any imperfection or incompleteness
in the actual performances of science. What is
the meaning of this conviction? What is the reality
thus anticipated? Whither does the developement of
this Idea conduct us?</p>
<p>We have already seen that a difficulty of the same
kind, which arises in the contemplation of causes and
effects considered as forming an historical series, drives
us to the assumption of a First Cause, as an Axiom <span class="pagenum" id="page252">252</span>
to which our Idea of Causation in time necessarily
leads. And as we were thus guided to a First Cause,
in order of Succession, the same kind of necessity
directs us to a Supreme Cause in order of Causation.</p>
<p>On this most weighty subject it is difficult to speak
fitly; and the present is not the proper occasion, even
for most of that which may be said. But there are
one or two remarks which flow from the general train
of the contemplations we have been engaged in, and
with which this Work must conclude.</p>
<p>We have seen how different are the kinds of cause
to which we are led by scientific researches. <i>Mechanical
Forces</i> are insufficient without <i>Chemical Affinities</i>;
Chemical Agencies fail us, and we are compelled
to have recourse to <i>Vital Powers</i>; Vital Powers cannot
be merely physical, and we must believe in something
hyperphysical, something of the nature of a <i>Soul</i>.
Not only do biological inquiries lead us to assume an
animal soul, but they drive us much further; they
bring before us <i>Perception</i>, and <i>Will</i> evoked
by Perception. Still more, these inquiries disclose to us <i>Ideas</i>
as the necessary forms of Perception, in the actions
of which we ourselves are conscious. We are aware,
we cannot help being aware, of our Ideas and our
Volitions as belonging to <em>us</em>, and thus we pass from
<em>things</em> to <em>persons</em>; we have the idea of <i>Personality</i>
awakened. And the idea of Design and <em>Purpose</em>, of
which we are conscious in our own minds, we find
reflected back to us, with a distinctness which we
cannot overlook, in all the arrangements which constitute
the frame of organized beings.</p>
<p>We cannot but reflect how widely diverse are the
kinds of principles thus set before us;&mdash;by what vast
strides we mount from the lower to the higher, as we
proceed through that series of causes which the range
of the sciences thus brings under our notice. Yet
we know how narrow is the range of these sciences
when compared with the whole extent of human knowledge.
We cannot doubt that on many other subjects,
besides those included in physical speculation, man has
made out solid and satisfactory trains of <span class="pagenum" id="page253">253</span> connexion;&mdash;has
discovered clear and indisputable evidence of causation.
It is manifest, therefore, that, if we are to
attempt to ascend to the Supreme Cause&mdash;if we are
to try to frame an idea of the Cause of all these subordinate
causes;&mdash;we must conceive it as more different from any
of them, than the most diverse are
from each other;&mdash;more elevated above the highest,
than the highest is above the lowest.</p>
<p>But further;&mdash;though the Supreme Cause must thus
be inconceivably different from all subordinate causes,
and immeasurably elevated above them all, it must
still include in itself all that is essential to each of
them, by virtue of that very circumstance that it is
the Cause of their Causality. Time and Space,&mdash;Infinite
Time and Infinite Space,&mdash;must be among its
attributes; for we cannot but conceive Infinite Time
and Space as attributes of the Infinite Cause of the
universe. Force and Matter must depend upon it
for their efficacy; for we cannot conceive the activity
of Force, or the resistance of Matter, to be independent
powers. But these are its lower attributes. The Vital
Powers, the Animal Soul, which are the Causes of the
actions of living things, are only the Effects of the
Supreme Cause of Life. And this Cause, even in the
lowest forms of organized bodies, and still more in
those which stand higher in the scale, involves a
reference to Ends and Purposes, in short, to manifest
Final Causes. Since this is so, and since, even when
we contemplate ourselves in a view studiously narrowed,
we still find that we have Ideas, and Will and
Personality, it would render our philosophy utterly
incoherent and inconsistent with itself, to suppose that
Personality, and Ideas, and Will, and Purpose, do not
belong to the Supreme Cause from which we derive
all that we have and all that we are.</p>
<p>But we may go a step further;&mdash;though, in our
present field of speculation, we confine ourselves
to knowledge founded on the facts which the external
world presents to us, we cannot forget, in speaking of
such a theme as that to which we have thus been led,
that these are but a small, and the least significant <span class="pagenum" id="page254">254</span>
portion of the facts which bear upon it. We cannot
fail to recollect that there are facts belonging to the
world within us, which more readily and strongly
direct our thoughts to the Supreme Cause of all
things. We can plainly discern that we have Ideas
elevated above the region of mechanical causation, of
animal existence, even of mere choice and will, which
still have a clear and definite significance, a permanent
and indestructible validity. We perceive as a fact,
that we have a Conscience, judging of Right and
Wrong; that we have Ideas of Moral Good and Evil,
that we are compelled to conceive the organization
of the moral world, as well as of the vital frame, to
be directed to an end and governed by a purpose.
And since the Supreme Cause is the cause of these
facts, the Origin of these Ideas, we cannot refuse to
recognize Him as not only the Maker, but the Governor
of the World; as not only a Creative, but a Providential
Power; as not only a Universal Father, but
an Ultimate Judge.</p>
<p>We have already passed beyond the boundary of
those speculations which we proposed to ourselves as
the basis of our conclusions. Yet we may be allowed
to add one other reflection. If we find in ourselves
Ideas of Good and Evil, manifestly bestowed upon us
to be the guides of our conduct, which guides we yet
find it impossible consistently to obey;&mdash;if we find
ourselves directed, even by our natural light, to aim at a
perfection of our moral nature from which we are constantly
deviating through weakness and perverseness;
if, when we thus lapse and err, we can find, in the
region of human philosophy, no power which can efface
our aberrations, or reconcile our actual with our ideal
being, or give us any steady hope and trust with regard
to our actions, after we have thus discovered their
incongruity with their genuine standard;&mdash;if we discern
that this is our condition, how can we fail to see
that it is in the highest degree consistent with all the
indications supplied by such a philosophy as that of
which we have been attempting to lay the foundations,
that the Supreme Cause, through whom man exists as <span class="pagenum" id="page255">255</span>
a moral being of vast capacities and infinite Hopes,
should have Himself provided a teaching for our ignorance,
a propitiation for our sin, a support for our
weakness, a purification and sanctification of our
nature?</p>
<p>And thus, in concluding our long survey of the
grounds and structure of science, and of the lessons
which the study of it teaches us, we find ourselves
brought to a point of view in which we can cordially
sympathize, and more than sympathize, with all the
loftiest expressions of admiration and reverence and
hope and trust, which have been uttered by those who
in former times have spoken of the elevated thoughts
to which the contemplation of the nature and progress
of human knowledge gives rise. We can not only hold
with Galen, and Harvey, and all the great physiologists,
that the organs of animals give evidence of a
purpose;&mdash;not only assert with Cuvier that this conviction
of a purpose can alone enable us to understand
every part of every living thing;&mdash;not only say with
Newton that ‘every true step made in philosophy
brings us nearer to the First Cause, and is on that
account highly to be valued;’&mdash;and that ‘the business
of natural philosophy is to deduce causes from effects,
till we come to the very First Cause, which certainly is
not mechanical;’&mdash;but we can go much farther, and
declare, still with Newton, that ‘this beautiful system
could have its origin no other way than by the purpose
and command of an intelligent and powerful Being,
who governs all things, not as the soul of the world,
but as the Lord of the Universe; who is not only God,
but Lord and Governor.’</p>
<p>When we have advanced so far, there yet remains
one step. We may recollect the prayer of one, the
master in this school of the philosophy of science:
‘This also we humbly and earnestly beg;&mdash;that human things
may not prejudice such as are divine;&mdash;neither that from
the unlocking of the gates of sense, and
the kindling of a greater natural light, anything may
arise of incredulity or intellectual night towards divine
mysteries; but rather that by our minds thoroughly <span class="pagenum" id="page256">256</span>
purged and cleansed from fancy and vanity, and yet
subject and perfectly given up to the divine oracles,
there may be given unto faith the things that are
faith’s.’ When we are thus prepared for a higher
teaching, we may be ready to listen to a greater than
Bacon, when he says to those who have sought their
God in the material universe, ‘Whom ye ignorantly
worship, him declare I unto you.’ And when we recollect
how utterly inadequate all human language has
been shown to be, to express the nature of that Supreme
Cause of the Natural, and Rational, and Moral,
and Spiritual world, to which our Philosophy points
with trembling finger and shaded eyes, we may receive,
with the less wonder but with the more reverence,
the declaration which has been vouchsafed to us:</p>

<p class="center sc">Introduction.</p>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> has been shown in the <i>History of the Sciences</i>,
and has further appeared in the course of the
<i>History of Ideas</i>, that almost every step in the progress
of science is marked by the formation or appropriation
of a technical term. Common language has,
in most cases, a certain degree of looseness and ambiguity;
as common knowledge has usually something of
vagueness and indistinctness. In common cases too,
knowledge usually does not occupy the intellect alone,
but more or less interests some affection, or puts in
action the fancy; and common language, accommodating itself
to the office of expressing such knowledge, contains,
in every sentence, a tinge of emotion
or of imagination. But when our knowledge becomes
perfectly exact and purely intellectual, we require a
language which shall also be exact and intellectual;&mdash;which
shall exclude alike vagueness and fancy, imperfection
and superfluity;&mdash;in which each term shall
convey a meaning steadily fixed and rigorously limited.
Such a language that of science becomes, through the
use of Technical Terms. And we must now endeavour
to lay down some maxims and suggestions, by attention
to which Technical Terms may be better fitted to
answer their purpose. In order to do this, we shall in <span class="pagenum" id="page258">258</span>
the first place take a rapid survey of the manner in
which Technical Terms have been employed from the
earliest periods of scientific history.</p>
<p class="end">The progress of the use of technical scientific language
offers to our notice two different and successive
periods; in the first of which, technical terms were
formed casually, as convenience in each case prompted;
while in the second period, technical language was
constructed intentionally, with set purpose, with a regard
to its connexion, and with a view of constructing a
system. Though the casual and the systematic formation
of technical terms cannot be separated by any
precise date of time, (for at all periods some terms in
some sciences have been framed unsystematically,) we
may, as a general description, call the former the <i>Ancient</i>
and the latter the <i>Modern</i> Period. In illustrating
the two following Aphorisms, I will give examples of
the course followed in each of these periods.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> I.</p>
<p><i>In the Ancient Period of Sciences, Technical Terms were
formed in three different ways:&mdash;by appropriating common
words and fixing their meaning;&mdash;by constructing terms
containing a description;&mdash;by constructing terms containing
reference to a theory.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> earliest sciences offer the earliest examples of
technical terms. These are Geometry, Arithmetic, and
Astronomy; to which we have soon after to add Harmonics,
Mechanics, and Optics. In these sciences, we
may notice the above-mentioned three different modes
in which technical terms were formed.</p>
<p id="b4a1a1">I. The simplest and first mode of acquiring technical
terms, is to take words current in common usage,
and by rigorously defining or otherwise fixing their
meaning, to fit them for the expression of scientific
truths. In this manner almost all the fundamental
technical terms of Geometry were formed. A <i>sphere</i>,
a <i>cone</i>, a <i>cylinder</i>, had among the Greeks, at first, <span class="pagenum" id="page259">259</span>
meanings less precise than those which geometers gave
to these words, and besides the mere designation of
form, implied some use or application. A <i>sphere</i>
(<span class="greek">σφαῖρα</span>) was a hand-ball used in games; a <i>cone</i> (<span class="greek">κῶνος</span>)
was a boy’s spinning-top, or the crest of a helmet; a
<i>cylinder</i> (<span class="greek">κύλινδρος</span>) was a roller; a <i>cube</i> (<span class="greek">κύβος</span>) was a
die: till these words were adopted by the geometers,
and made to signify among them pure modifications of
space. So an <i>angle</i> (<span class="greek">γωνία</span>) was only a corner; a <i>point</i>
(<span class="greek">σημεῖον</span>) was a signal; a <i>line</i> (<span class="greek">γραμμὴ</span>) was a mark; a
<i>straight</i> line (<span class="greek">εὐθεῖα</span>) was marked by an adjective which
at first meant only <i>direct</i>. A <i>plane</i> (<span class="greek">ἐπίπεδον</span>) is the
neuter form of an adjective, which by its derivation
means <i>on the ground</i>, and hence <i>flat</i>. In all these
cases, the word adopted as a term of science has its
sense rigorously fixed; and where the common use of
the term is in any degree vague, its meaning may be
modified at the same time that it is thus limited.
Thus a <i>rhombus</i> (<span class="greek">ῥόμβος</span>) by its derivation, might mean
any figure which is <i>twisted</i> out of a regular form; but
it is confined by geometers to that figure which has
four equal sides, its angles being oblique. In like
manner, a <i>trapezium</i> (<span class="greek">τραπέζιον</span>) originally signifies a
<i>table</i>, and thus might denote any form; but as the tables
of the Greeks had one side shorter than the opposite one, such a
figure was at first called a <i>trapezium</i>.
Afterwards the term was made to signify any figure
with four unequal sides; a name being more needful in
geometry for this kind of figure than for the original
form.</p>
<p>This class of technical terms, namely, words adopted
from common language, but rendered precise and
determinate for purposes of science, may also be
exemplified in other sciences. Thus, as was observed in the
early portion of the history of
astronomy<a id="fnanchor1-4" href="#note1-4"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>,
a <i>day</i>, a
<i>month</i>, a <i>year</i>, described at first portions of time marked
by familiar changes, but afterwards portions determined
by rigorous mathematical definitions. The conception
of the heavens as a revolving sphere, is so obvious, <span class="pagenum" id="page260">260</span>
that we may consider the terms which involve this
conception as parts of common language; as the <i>pole</i>
(<span class="greek">πόλος</span>); the <i>arctic circle</i>, which includes the stars that
never set<a id="fnanchor2-4" href="#note2-4"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>;
the <i>horizon</i> (<span class="greek">ὁρίζων</span>) a boundary, applied
technically to the circle bounding the visible earth
and sky. The <i>turnings of the sun</i> (<span class="greek">τροπαὶ ἠελίοιο</span>),
which are mentioned by Hesiod, gave occasion to the
term <i>tropics</i>, the circles at which the sun in his annual
motion turns back from his northward or southward
advance. The <i>zones</i> of the earth, (the <i>torrid</i>,
<i>temperate</i>, and <i>frigid</i>;) the <i>gnomon</i> of a dial; the <i>limb</i> (or
border) of the moon, or of a circular instrument, are
terms of the same class. An <i>eclipse</i> (<span class="greek">ἔκλειψις</span>) is
originally a deficiency or disappearance, and joined with
the name of the luminary, an <i>eclipse of the sun</i> or <i>of
the moon</i>, described the phenomenon; but when the
term became technical, it sufficed, without addition, to
designate the phenomenon.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-4" href="#fnanchor2-4">2</a></span>
<i>Hist. Ast.</i> b. iii. c. i. sect. 8.
</div>
<p>In Mechanics, the Greeks gave a scientific precision
to very few words: we may mention <i>weights</i> (<span class="greek">βάρεα</span>),
the <i>arms of a lever</i> (<span class="greek">μήχεα</span>), its <i>fulcrum</i>
(<span class="greek">ὑπομόχλιον</span>),
and the verb <i>to balance</i> (<span class="greek">ἰσσοῤῥοπεῖν</span>). Other terms
which they used, as <i>momentum</i> (<span class="greek">ῥοπὴ</span>)
and <i>force</i> (<span class="greek">δύναμις</span>),
did not acquire a distinct and definite meaning till the
time of Galileo, or later. We may observe that all
abstract terms, though in their scientific application
expressing mere conceptions, were probably at first
derived from some word describing external objects.
Thus the Latin word for force, <i>vis</i>, seems to be connected
with a Greek word, <span class="greek">ἲς</span>, or
<span class="greek">ϝὶς</span>, which often has
nearly the same meaning; but originally, as it would
seem, signified a sinew or muscle, the obvious seat of
animal strength.</p>
<p>In later times, the limitation imposed upon a word
by its appropriation to scientific purposes, is often
more marked than in the cases above described. Thus
the <i>variation</i> is made to mean, in astronomy, the second
inequality of the moon’s motion; in magnetism,
the <i>variation</i> signifies the angular deviation of the <span class="pagenum" id="page261">261</span>
compass-needle from the north; in pure mathematics,
the <i>variation</i> of a quantity is the formula which expresses
the result of any small change of the most
general kind. In like manner, <i>parallax</i> (<span class="greek">παράλλαξις</span>)
denotes a <i>change</i> in general, but is used by astronomers
to signify the change produced by the spectator’s being
removed from the center of the earth, his theoretical
place, to the surface. <i>Alkali</i> at first denoted the ashes
of a particular plant, but afterwards, all bodies having
a certain class of chemical properties; and, in like
manner, <i>acid</i>, the class opposed to alkali, was modified
in signification by chemists, so as to refer no longer to
the taste.</p>
<p>Words thus borrowed from common language, and
converted by scientific writers into technical terms,
have some advantages and some disadvantages. They
possess this great convenience, that they are understood
after a very short explanation, and retained in
the memory without effort. On the other hand, they
lead to some inconvenience; for since they have a
meaning in common language, a careless reader is
prone to disregard the technical limitation of this
meaning, and to attempt to collect their import in scientific
books, in the same vague and conjectural manner in which he
collects the purpose of words in common cases. Hence the
language of science, when thus
resembling common language, is liable to be employed
with an absence of that scientific precision which alone
gives it value. Popular writers and talkers, when they
speak of <i>force</i>, <i>momentum</i>, <i>action and reaction</i>, and
the like, often afford examples of the inaccuracy thus
arising from the scientific appropriation of common
terms.</p>
<p id="b4a1a2">II. Another class of technical terms, which we
find occurring as soon as speculative science assumes a
distinct shape, consists of those which are intentionally
constructed by speculators, and which contain some
description or indication distinctive of the conception
to which they are applied. Such are a <i>parallelogram</i>
(<span class="greek">παραλληλόγραμμον</span>), which denotes a plane figure
bounded by two pairs of parallel lines; a <i>parallelopiped</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="page262">262</span>
(<span class="greek">παραλληλοπίπεδον</span>), which signifies a solid figure
bounded by three pairs of parallel planes. A <i>triangle</i>
(<span class="greek">τρίγωνος</span>, <i>trigon</i>) and a
<i>quadrangle</i> (<span class="greek">τετράγωνος</span>,
<i>tetragon</i>) were perhaps words invented independently of
the mathematicians: but such words extended to other
cases, <i>pentagon</i>, <i>decagon</i>, <i>heccædecagon</i>, <i>polygon</i>, are
inventions of scientific men. Such also are <i>tetrahedron</i>,
<i>hexahedron</i>, <i>dodecahedron</i>, <i>tesseracontaoctohedron</i>,
<i>polyhedron</i>, and the like. These words being constructed
by speculative writers, explain themselves, or
at least require only some conventional limitation,
easily adopted. Thus <i>parallelogram</i>, might mean a
figure bounded by any number of sets of parallel lines,
but it is conventionally restricted to a figure of <em>four</em>
sides. So a <i>great circle</i> in a sphere means one which
passes through the center of the sphere; and a <i>small
circle</i> is any other. So in trigonometry, we have the
hypotenuse (<span class="greek">ὑποτενοῦσα</span>), or <i>subtending</i> line,
to designate the line subtending an angle, and especially a
right angle. In this branch of mathematics we have
many invented technical terms; as <i>complement</i>, <i>supplement</i>,
<i>cosine</i>, <i>cotangent</i>, a <i>spherical angle</i>, the <i>pole of a
circle</i>, or of a sphere. The word <i>sine</i> itself appears to
belong to the class of terms already described as scientific
appropriations of common terms, although its
origin is somewhat obscure.</p>
<p>Mathematicians were naturally led to construct
these and many other terms by the progress of their
speculations. In like manner, when astronomy took
the form of a speculative science, words were invented
to denote distinctly the conceptions thus introduced.
Thus the sun’s annual path among the stars, in which
not only solar, but also all lunar eclipses occur, was
termed the <i>ecliptic</i>. The circle which the sun describes
in his diurnal motion, when the days and nights are
equal, the Greeks called the <i>equidiurnal</i> (<span class="greek">ἰσημερινὸς</span>,)
the Latin astronomers the <i>equinoctial</i>, and the corresponding
circle on the earth was the <i>equator</i>. The
ecliptic intersected the equinoctial in the <i>equinoctial
points</i>. The <i>solstices</i> (in Greek, <span class="greek">τροπαὶ</span>) were the times
when the sun arrested his motion northwards or
<span class="pagenum" id="page263">263</span> southwards;
and the <i>solstitial points</i> (<span class="greek">τὰ τροπικὰ σημεῖα</span>)
were the places, in the ecliptic where he then was.
The name of <i>meridians</i> was given to circles passing
through the poles of the equator; the <i>solstitial colure</i>
(<span class="greek">κόλουρος</span>, curtailed), was one of these circles, which
passes through the solstitial points, and is intercepted
by the horizon.</p>
<p>We have borrowed from the Arabians various astronomical terms,
as <i>Zenith</i>, <i>Nadir</i>, <i>Azimuth</i>, <i>Almacantar</i>.
And these words, which among the Arabians probably
belonged to the first class, of appropriated scientific
terms, are for us examples of the second class, invented
scientific terms; although they differ from most that
we have mentioned, in not containing an etymology
corresponding to their meaning in any language with
which European cultivators of science are generally
familiar. Indeed, the distinction of our two classes,
though convenient, is in a great measure, casual. Thus
most of the words we formerly mentioned, as <i>parallax</i>,
<i>horizon</i>, <i>eclipse</i>, though appropriated technical terms
among the Greeks, are to us invented technical terms.</p>
<p>In the construction of such terms as we are now considering,
those languages have a great advantage which
possess a power of forming words by composition. This
was eminently the case with the Greek language; and
hence most of the ancient terms of science in that language,
when their origin is once explained, are clearly
understood and easily retained. Of modern European
languages, the German possesses the greatest facility of
composition; and hence scientific authors in that language
are able to invent terms which it is impossible
to imitate in the other languages of Europe. Thus
Weiss distinguishes his various systems of crystals as
<i>zwei-und-zwei-gliedrig</i>, <i>ein-und-zwei-gliedrig</i>,
<i>drey-und-drey-gliedrig,</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>, (two-and-two-membered,
one-and-two-membered, &amp;c.) And Hessel, also a writer on
crystallography, speaks of <i>doubly-one-membered edges</i>,
<i>four-and-three spaced rays</i>, and the like.</p>
<p>How far the composition of words, in such cases,
may be practised in the English language, and the
general question, what are the best rules and artifices <span class="pagenum" id="page264">264</span>
in such cases, I shall afterwards consider. In the
mean time, I may observe that this list of invented
technical terms might easily be much enlarged. Thus
in harmonics we have the various intervals, as a <i>Fourth</i>,
a <i>Fifth</i>, an <i>Octave</i>, (<i>Diatessaron</i>, <i>Diapente</i>, <i>Diapason</i>,) a
<i>Comma</i>, which is the difference of a <i>Major</i> and <i>Minor
Tone</i>; we have the various <i>Moods</i> or <i>Keys</i>, and the
notes of various lengths, as <i>Minims</i>, <i>Breves</i>, <i>Semibreves</i>,
<i>Quavers</i>. In chemistry, <i>Gas</i> was at first a technical
term invented by Van Helmont, though it has now
been almost adopted into common language. I omit
many words which will perhaps suggest themselves to
the reader, because they belong rather to the next
class, which I now proceed to notice.</p>
<p id="b4a1a3">III. The third class of technical terms consists of
such as are constructed by men of science, and involve
some theoretical idea in the meaning which their derivation
implies. They do not merely describe, like the
class last spoken of, but describe with reference to
some doctrine or hypothesis which is accepted as a
portion of science. Thus <i>latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>, according
to their origin, signify breadth and length;
they are used, however, to denote measures of the distance
of a place on the earth’s surface from the equator,
and from the first meridian, of which distances, one
cannot be called <i>length</i> more properly than the other.
But this appropriation of these words may be explained
by recollecting that the earth, as known to the ancient
geographers, was much further extended from east to
west than from north to south. The <i>Precession</i> of the
equinoxes is a term which implies that the stars are
fixed, while the point which is the origin of the measure
of celestial longitude moves backward. The <i>Right
Ascension</i> of a star is a measure of its position corresponding
to terrestrial longitude; this quantity is identical
with the angular ascent of the equinoctial point,
when the star is in the horizon in a <i>right</i> sphere; that
is, a sphere which supposes the spectator to be at the
equator. The <i>Oblique Ascension</i> (a term now little
used), is derived in like manner from an oblique sphere.
The motion of a planet is <i>direct</i> or <i>retrograde</i>, <i>in</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page265">265</span>
<i>consequentia</i> (<i>signa</i>), or <i>in antecedentia</i>, in reference to a
certain assumed standard direction for celestial motions,
namely, the direction opposite to that of the sun’s daily
motion, and agreeing with his annual motion among
the stars; or with what is much more evident, the
moon’s monthly motion. The <i>equation of time</i> is the
quantity which must be added to or subtracted from
the time marked by the sun, in order to reduce it to a
theoretical condition of equable progress. In like
manner the <i>equation of the center</i> of the sun or of the
moon is the angle which must be added to, or subtracted
from, the actual advance of the luminary in
the heavens, in order to make its motion equable.
Besides the equation of the center of the moon, which
represents the first and greatest of her deviations from
equable motion, there are many other <i>equations</i>, by
the application of which her motion is brought nearer
and nearer to perfect uniformity. The second of these
equations is called the <i>evection</i>, the third the <i>variation</i>,
the fourth the <i>annual equation</i>, The motion of the
sun as affected by its inequalities is called his <i>anomaly</i>,
which term denotes inequality. In the History of
Astronomy, we find that the inequable motions of the
sun, moon, and planets were, in a great measure, reduced
to rule and system by the Greeks, by the aid of
an hypothesis of circles, revolving, and carrying in
their motion other circles which also revolved. This
hypothesis introduced many technical terms, as <i>deferent</i>,
<i>epicycle</i>, <i>eccentric</i>. In like manner, the theories
which have more recently taken the place of the
theory of epicycles have introduced other technical
terms, as the <i>elliptical orbit</i>, the <i>radius vector</i>, and the
<i>equable description of areas</i> by this radius, which phrases
express the true laws of the planetary motions.</p>
<p>There is no subject on which theoretical views have
been so long and so extensively prevalent as astronomy,
and therefore no other science in which there are so
many technical terms of the kind we are now considering.
But in other subjects also, so far as theories have
been established, they have been accompanied by the
introduction or fixation of technical terms. Thus, as <span class="pagenum" id="page266">266</span>
we have seen in the examination of the foundations of
mechanics, the terms <i>force</i> and <i>inertia</i> derive their
precise meaning from a recognition of the first law of
motion; <i>accelerating force</i> and <i>composition of motion</i>
involve the second law; <i>moving force</i>, <i>momentum</i>, <i>action</i>
and <i>reaction</i>, are expressions which imply the third law.
The term <i>vis viva</i> was introduced to express a general
property of moving bodies; and other terms have been
introduced for like purposes, as <i>impetus</i> by Smeaton,
and <i>work done</i>, by other engineers. In the recent
writings of several French engineers, the term <i>travail</i>
is much employed, to express the work done and the
force which does it: this term has been rendered by
<i>labouring force</i>. The proposition which was termed
the <i>hydrostatic paradox</i> had this name in reference to
its violating a supposed law of the action of forces.
The verb to <i>gravitate</i>, and the abstract term <i>gravitation</i>,
sealed the establishment of Newton’s theory of
the solar system.</p>
<p>In some of the sciences, opinions, either false, or
disguised in very fantastical imagery, have prevailed;
and the terms which have been introduced during the
reign of such opinions, bear the impress of the time.
Thus in the days of alchemy, the substances with
which the operator dealt were personified; and a metal
when exhibited pure and free from all admixture was
considered as a little king, and was hence called a
<i>regulus</i>, a term not yet quite obsolete. In like manner,
a substance from which nothing more of any value
could be extracted, was dead, and was called a <i>caput
mortuum</i>. Quick silver, that is, live silver (<i>argentum
vivum</i>), was killed by certain admixtures, and was
<i>revived</i> when restored to its pure state.</p>
<p>We find a great number of medical terms which
bear the mark of opinions formerly prevalent among
physicians; and though these opinions hardly form a
part of the progress of science, and were not presented
in our History, we may notice some of these terms as
examples of the mode in which words involve in their
derivation obsolete opinions. Such words as <i>hysterics</i>,
<i>hypochondriac</i>, <i>melancholy</i>, <i>cholera</i>, <i>colic</i>,
<i>quinsey</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page267">267</span>
(<i>squinantia</i>, <span class="greek">συνάγχη</span>, a suffocation), <i>megrim</i>,
<i>migrane</i> (<i>hemicranium</i>, the middle of the skull), <i>rickets</i>, (<i>rachitis</i>,
from <span class="greek">ῥάχις</span>, the backbone), <i>palsy</i>,
(<i>paralysis</i>, <span class="greek">παράλυσις</span>,)
<i>apoplexy</i> (<span class="greek">ἀποπληξία</span>, a stroke),
<i>emrods</i>, (<span class="greek">αἱμοῤῥοΐδες</span>,
<i>hemorrhoids</i>, a flux of blood), <i>imposthume</i>, (corrupted
from <i>aposteme</i>, <span class="greek">ἀπόστημα</span>, an abscess), <i>phthisis</i>
(<span class="greek">φθίσις</span>, consumption), <i>tympanum</i>
(<span class="greek">τυμπανία</span>, swelling),
<i>dropsy</i> (<i>hydropsy</i>, <span class="greek">ὕδρωψ</span>,)
<i>sciatica</i>, isciatica (<span class="greek">ἰσκιαδικὴ</span>,
from <span class="greek">ἰσκίον</span>, the hip), <i>catarrh</i>
(<span class="greek">κατάῤῥους</span>, a flowing
down), <i>diarrhœa</i> (<span class="greek">διαῤῥοία</span>,
a flowing through), <i>diabetes</i>
(<span class="greek">διαβήτης</span>, a passing through),
<i>dysentery</i> (<span class="greek">δυσεντερία</span>, a
disorder of the entrails), <i>arthritic</i> pains (from <span class="greek">ἄρθρα</span>,
the joints), are names derived from the supposed or
real seat and circumstances of the diseases. The word
from which the first of the above names is derived
(<span class="greek">ὑστέρα</span>, the last place,) signifies the womb, according
to its order in a certain systematic enumeration of
parts. The second word, <i>hypochondriac</i>, means something
affecting the viscera below the cartilage of the
breastbone, which cartilage is called <span class="greek">χόνδρος</span>;
<i>melancholy</i> and <i>cholera</i> derive their names from supposed
affections of <span class="greek">χολὴ</span>, the bile. <i>Colic</i> is that which affects
the <i>colon</i> (<span class="greek">κῶλον</span>), the largest member of the bowels.
A disorder of the eye is called <i>gutta serena</i> (the ‘drop
serene’ of Milton), in contradistinction to <i>gutta turbida</i>,
in which the impediment to vision is perceptibly
opake. Other terms also record the opinions of the
ancient anatomists, as <i>duodenum</i>, a certain portion of
the intestines, which they estimated as twelve inches
long. We might add other allusions, as the <i>tendon of
Achilles</i>.</p>
<p>Astrology also supplied a number of words founded
upon fanciful opinions; but this study having been
expelled from the list of sciences, such words now
survive, only so far as they have found a place in common
language. Thus men were termed <i>mercurial</i>, <i>martial</i>,
<i>jovial</i>, or <i>saturnine</i>, accordingly as their characters
were supposed to be determined by the influence of the
planets, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn. Other
expressions, such as <i>disastrous</i>, <i>ill-starred</i>, <i>exorbitant</i>,
<i>lord of the ascendant</i>, and hence <i>ascendancy</i>,
<i>influence</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page268">268</span>
a <i>sphere of action</i>, and the like, may serve to show
how extensively astrological opinions have affected
language, though the doctrine is no longer a recognized
science.</p>
<p>The preceding examples will make it manifest that
opinions, even of a recondite and complex kind, are
often implied in the derivation of words; and thus will
show how scientific terms, framed by the cultivators
of science, may involve received hypotheses and theories.
When terms are thus constructed, they serve
not only to convey with ease, but to preserve steadily
and to diffuse widely, the opinions which they thus
assume. Moreover, they enable the speculator to employ
these complex conceptions, the creations of science,
and the results of much labour and thought, as
readily and familiarly as if they were convictions
borrowed at once from the senses. They are thus powerful
instruments in enabling philosophers to ascend
from one step of induction and generalization to another;
and hereby contribute powerfully to the advance of knowledge and truth.</p>
<p>It should be noticed, before we proceed, that the
names of natural objects, when they come to be considered
as the objects of a science, are selected according to the
processes already enumerated. For the
most part, the natural historian adopts the common
names of animals, plants, minerals, gems, and the like,
and only endeavours to secure their steady and consistent
application. But many of these names imply some
peculiar, often fanciful, belief respecting the object.</p>
<p>Various plants derive their names from their supposed
virtues, as <i>herniaria</i>, <i>rupture-wort</i>; or from legends,
as <i>herba Sancti Johannis</i>, <i>St. John’s wort</i>. The
same is the case with minerals: thus the <i>topaz</i> was
asserted to come from an island so shrouded in mists
that navigators could only <i>conjecture</i> (<span class="greek">τοπάζειν</span>) where
it was. In these latter cases, however, the legend is
often not the true origin of the name, but is suggested
by it.</p>
<p>The privilege of constructing names where they are
wanted, belongs to natural historians no less than to <span class="pagenum" id="page269">269</span>
the cultivators of physical science; yet in the ancient
world, writers of the former class appear rarely to
have exercised this privilege, even when they felt the
imperfections of the current language. Thus Aristotle
repeatedly mentions classes of animals which have no
name, as co-ordinate with classes that have names;
but he hardly ventures to propose names which may
supply these defects<a id="fnanchor3-4" href="#note3-4"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>.
The vast importance of nomenclature
in natural history was not recognized till the
modern period.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-4" href="#fnanchor3-4">3</a></span>
In his <i>History of Animals</i>, (b. i. c. vi.), he says,
that the great classes of animals are Quadrupeds, Birds,
Fishes, Whales (<i>Cetaceans</i>), Oysters (<i>Testaceans</i>),
animals like crabs which have no general name (<i>Crustaceans</i>),
soft animals (<i>Mollusks</i> and <i>Insects</i>). He does,
however, call the Crustaces by a name (<i>Malacostraca</i>, soft-shelled)
which has since been adopted by Naturalists.
</div>
<p class="end">We have, however, hitherto considered only the
formation or appropriation of single terms in science;
except so far as several terms may in some instances
be connected by reference to a common theory. But
when the value of technical terms began to be fully
appreciated, philosophers proceeded to introduce them
into their sciences more copiously and in a more systematic
manner. In this way, the modern history of
technical language has some features of a different
aspect from the ancient; and must give rise to a separate Aphorism.</p>
<p class="center" id="a2"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> II.</p>
<p><i>In the Modern Period of Science, besides the three processes
anciently employed in the formation of technical
terms, there have been introduced Systematic Nomenclature,
Systematic Terminology, and the Systematic Modification of
Terms to express theoretical relations</i><a id="fnanchor4-4" href="#note4-4"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-4" href="#fnanchor4-4">4</a></span>
On the subject of Terminology and Nomenclature,
see also Aphorisms <a href="#a88">LXXXVIII</a> and <a href="#a98">XCVIII</a> concerning Ideas,
and b. viii. c. ii. of the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>. In those
places I have spoken of the distinction of <i>Terminology</i>
and <i>Nomenclature</i>.
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Writers</span> upon science have gone on up to modern
times forming such technical terms as they had occasion for,
by the three processes above <span class="pagenum" id="page270">270</span> described;&mdash;namely,
appropriating and limiting words in common
use;&mdash;constructing for themselves words descriptive of
the conception which they wished to convey;&mdash;or
framing terms which by their signification imply the
adoption of a theory. Thus among the terms introduced
by the study of the connexion between magnetism and electricity,
the word <i>pole</i> is an example of the
first kind; the name of the subject, <i>electro-magnetism</i>,
of the second; and the term <i>current</i>, involving an
hypothesis of the motion of a fluid, is an instance of the
third class. In chemistry, the term <i>salt</i> was adopted
from common language, and its meaning extended to
denote any compound of a certain kind; the term <i>neutral</i>
salt implied the notion of a balanced opposition in
the two elements of the compound; and such words as
<i>subacid</i> and <i>superacid</i>, invented on purpose,
were introduced to indicate the cases in which this balance
was not attained. Again, when the phlogistic theory
of chemistry was established, the term <i>phlogiston</i> was
introduced to express the theory, and from this such
terms as <i>phlogisticated</i> and <i>dephlogisticated</i> were derived,
exclusively words of science. But in such instances
as have just been given, we approach towards
a systematic modification of terms, which is a peculiar
process of modern times. Of this, modern chemistry
forms a prominent example, which we shall soon consider,
but we shall first notice the other processes mentioned
in the Aphorism.</p>
<p id="b4a2a1">I. In ancient times, no attempt was made to invent
or select a Nomenclature of the objects of Natural
History which should be precise and permanent. The
omission of this step by the ancient naturalists gave
rise to enormous difficulty and loss of time when the
sciences resumed their activity. We have seen in the
history of the sciences of classification, and of botany
in especial<a id="fnanchor5-4" href="#note5-4"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>,
that the early cultivators of that study in
modern times endeavoured to identify all the plants
described by Greek and Roman writers with those
which grow in the north of Europe; and were involved <span class="pagenum" id="page271">271</span>
in endless confusion<a id="fnanchor6-4" href="#note6-4"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>,
by the multiplication of names
of plants, at the same time superfluous and ambiguous.
The <i>Synonymies</i> which botanists (Bauhin and others)
found it necessary to publish, were the evidences of
these inconveniences. In consequence of the defectiveness
of the ancient botanical nomenclature, we are
even yet uncertain with respect to the identification of
some of the most common trees mentioned by classical
writers<a id="fnanchor7-4" href="#note7-4"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>.
The ignorance of botanists respecting the
importance of nomenclature operated in another manner to
impede the progress of science. As a good nomenclature
presupposes a good system of classification,
so, on the other hand, a system of classification cannot
become permanent without a corresponding nomenclature.
Cæsalpinus, in the sixteenth
century<a id="fnanchor8-4" href="#note8-4"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>, published
an excellent system of arrangement for plants; but
this, not being connected with any system of names,
was never extensively accepted, and soon fell into oblivion.
The business of framing a scientific botanical
classification was in this way delayed for about a century.
In the same manner, Willoughby’s classification
of fishes, though, as Cuvier says, far better than any
which preceded it, was never extensively adopted, in
consequence of having no nomenclature connected
with it.</p>

</div>
<p id="b4a2a2">II. Probably one main cause which so long retarded
the work of fixing at the same time the arrangement
and the names of plants, was the great number of minute
and diversified particulars in the structure of each
plant which such a process implied. The stalks, leaves,
flowers, and fruits of vegetables, with their appendages,
may vary in so many ways, that common language is quite
insufficient to express clearly and precisely their
resemblances and differences. Hence
botany required not only a fixed system of <em>names</em> of
plants, but also an artificial system of phrases fitted to
<em>describe</em> their parts: not only a <i>Nomenclature</i>,
but also <span class="pagenum" id="page272">272</span>
a <i>Terminology</i>. The Terminology was, in fact, an
instrument indispensably requisite in giving fixity to the
Nomenclature. The recognition of the kinds of plants
must depend upon the exact comparison of their resemblances
and differences; and to become a part of
permanent science, this comparison must be recorded
in words.</p>
<p>The formation of an exact descriptive language for
botany was thus the first step in that systematic
construction of the technical language of science, which is
one of the main features in the intellectual history of
modern times. The ancient botanists, as De
Candolle<a id="fnanchor9-4" href="#note9-4"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>
says, did not make any attempt to select terms of
which the sense was rigorously determined; and each
of them employed in his descriptions the words, metaphors,
or periphrases which his own genius suggested.
In the History of Botany<a id="fnanchor10-4" href="#note10-4"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>,
I have noticed some of the
persons who contributed to this improvement. ‘Clusius,’
it is there stated, ‘first taught botanists to describe well.
He introduced exactitude, precision, neatness, elegance, method:
he says nothing superfluous;
he omits nothing necessary.’ This task was further
carried on by Jung and Ray<a id="fnanchor11-4" href="#note11-4"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>.
In these authors we
see the importance which began to be attached to the
exact definition of descriptive terms; for example, Ray
quotes Jung’s definition of <i>Caulis</i>, a stalk.</p>

</div>
<p>The improvement of descriptive language, and the
formation of schemes of classification of plants, went
on gradually for some time, and was much advanced
by Tournefort. But at last Linnæus embodied and
followed out the convictions which had gradually been
accumulating in the breasts of botanists; and by remodelling
throughout both the terminology and the
nomenclature of botany, produced one of the greatest
reforms which ever took place in any science. He
thus supplied a conspicuous example of such a reform,
and a most admirable model of a language, from which <span class="pagenum" id="page273">273</span>
other sciences may gather great instruction. I shall
not here give any account of the terms and words introduced
by Linnæus. They have been exemplified in
the <i>History of
Science</i><a id="fnanchor12-4" href="#note12-4"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>;
and the principles which they
involve I shall consider separately hereafter. I will
only remind the reader that the great simplification in
<i>nomenclature</i> which was the result of his labours, consisted
in designating each kind of plant by a <i>binary</i>
term consisting of the name of the <i>genus</i> combined
with that of the <i>species</i>: an artifice seemingly obvious,
but more convenient in its results than could possibly
have been anticipated.</p>

<i>Ib.</i> c. iv. sect. 1&ndash;3.
</div>
<p>Since Linnæus, the progress of Botanical Anatomy
and of Descriptive Botany have led to the rejection of
several inexact expressions, and to the adoption of
several new terms, especially in describing the structure
of the fruit and the parts of cryptogamous plants.
Hedwig, Medikus, Necker, Desvaux, Mirbel, and especially
Gærtner, Link, and Richard, have proposed
several useful innovations, in these as in other parts
of the subject; but the general mass of the words
now current consists still, and will probably continue
to consist, of the terms established by the Swedish
Botanist<a id="fnanchor13-4" href="#note13-4"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>.</p>

<p>When it was seen that botany derived so great advantages
from a systematic improvement of its language, it was
natural that other sciences, and especially
classificatory sciences, should endeavour to follow its
example. This attempt was made in Mineralogy by
Werner, and afterwards further pursued by Mohs.
Werner’s innovations in the descriptive language of
Mineralogy were the result of great acuteness, an intimate
acquaintance with minerals, and a most methodical spirit:
and were in most respects great improvements upon previous
practices. Yet the introduction
of them into Mineralogy was far from regenerating
that science, as Botany had been regenerated by the
Linnæan reform. It would seem that the perpetual <span class="pagenum" id="page274">274</span>
scrupulous attention to most minute differences, (as of
lustre, colour, fracture,) the greater part of which are
not really important, fetters the mind, rather than
disciplines it or arms it for generalization. Cuvier has
remarked<a id="fnanchor14-4" href="#note14-4"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>
that Werner, after his first <i>Essay on the
Characters of Minerals</i>, wrote little; as if he had been
afraid of using the system which he had created, and
desirous of escaping from the chains which he had
imposed upon others. And he justly adds, that Werner
dwelt least, in his descriptions, upon that which is
really the most important feature of all, the crystalline
structure. This, which is truly a definite character,
like those of Botany, does, when it can be clearly discerned,
determine the place of the mineral in a system.
This, therefore, is the character which, of all others,
ought to be most carefully expressed by an appropriate
language. This task, hardly begun by Werner, has
since been fully executed by others, especially by Romé
de l’Isle, Haüy, and Mohs. All the forms of crystals
can be described in the most precise manner by the
aid of the labours of these writers and their successors.
But there is one circumstance well worthy our notice
in these descriptions. It is found that the language
in which they can best be conveyed is not that of
words, but of <em>symbols</em>. The relations of space which
are involved in the forms of crystalline bodies, though
perfectly definite, are so complex and numerous, that
they cannot be expressed, except in the language of
mathematics: and thus we have an extensive and
recondite branch of mathematical science, which is, in
fact, only a part of the Terminology of the mineralogist.</p>

<i>Éloges</i>, ii. 134.
</div>
<p>The Terminology of Mineralogy being thus reformed,
an attempt was made to improve its Nomenclature also,
by following the example of Botany. Professor Mohs
was the proposer of this innovation. The names framed
by him were, however, not composed of two but of
three elements, designating respectively the Species,
the Genus, and the Order<a id="fnanchor15-4" href="#note15-4"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>:
thus he has such species as <span class="pagenum" id="page275">275</span>
<i>Rhombohedral Lime Haloide</i>, <i>Octahedral Fluor Haloide</i>,
<i>Prismatic Hal Baryte</i>. These names have not been
generally adopted; nor is it likely that any names
constructed on such a scheme will find acceptance
among mineralogists, till the higher divisions of the
system are found to have some definite character. We
see no real mineralogical significance in Mohs’s Genera
and Orders, and hence we do not expect them to retain
a permanent place in the science.</p>

<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xv. c. ix.
</div>
<p>The only systematic names which have hitherto
been generally admitted in Mineralogy, are those
expressing the chemical constitution of the substance;
and these belong to a system of technical terms
different from any we have yet spoken of, namely to
terms formed by systematic modification.</p>
<p id="b4a2a3">III. The language of Chemistry was already, as we
have seen, tending to assume a systematic character,
even under the reign of the phlogiston theory. But
when oxygen succeeded to the throne, it very fortunately
happened that its supporters had the courage
and the foresight to undertake a completely new and
systematic recoinage of the terms belonging to the science.
The new nomenclature was constructed upon a
principle hitherto hardly applied in science, but eminently
commodious and fertile; namely, the principle
of indicating a modification of relations of elements,
by a change in the termination of the word. Thus
the new chemical school spoke of sulph<i>uric</i> and sulph<i>urous</i>
acids; of sulph<i>ates</i> and sulph<i>ites</i> of bases; and
of sulph<i>urets</i> of metals; and in like manner, of phos<i>phoric</i>
and phos<i>phorous</i> acids, of phos<i>phates</i>, phos<i>phites</i>,
phos<i>phurets</i>. In this manner a nomenclature was produced,
in which the very name of a substance indicated
at once its constitution and place in the system.</p>
<p>The introduction of this chemical language can never
cease to be considered one of the most important steps
ever made in the improvement of technical terms; and
as a signal instance of the advantages which may result
from artifices apparently trivial, if employed in a
manner conformable to the laws of phenomena, and
systematically pursued. It was, however, proved that <span class="pagenum" id="page276">276</span>
this language, with all its merits, had some defects.
The relations of elements in composition were discovered
to be more numerous than the modes of
expression which the terminations supplied. Besides
the sulphurous and sulphuric acids, it appeared there
were others; these were called the <i>hyposulphurous</i> and
<i>hyposulphuric</i>: but these names, though convenient,
no longer implied, by their form, any definite relation.
The compounds of Nitrogen and Oxygen are, in order,
the <i>Protoxide</i>, the <i>Deutoxide</i> or <i>Binoxide</i>;
<i>Hyponitrous</i> Acid, <i>Nitrous</i> Acid, and <i>Nitric</i> Acid. The
nomenclature here ceases to be systematic. We have
three oxides of Iron, of which we may call the first the
<i>Protoxide</i>, but we cannot call the others the <i>Deutoxide</i>
and <i>Trioxide</i>, for by doing so we should convey a
perfectly erroneous notion of the proportions of the
elements. They are called the <i>Protoxide</i>, the <i>Black</i>
Oxide, and the <i>Peroxide</i>. We are here thrown back
upon terms quite unconnected with the system.</p>
<p>Other defects in the nomenclature arose from errours
in the theory; as for example the names of the muriatic,
oxymuriatic, and hyperoxymuriatic acids; which,
after the establishment of the new theory of chlorine,
were changed to <i>hydrochloric</i> acid, <i>chlorine</i>, and <i>chloric</i>
acid.</p>
<p>Thus the chemical system of nomenclature, founded
upon the oxygen theory, while it shows how much may
be effected by a good and consistent scheme of terms,
framed according to the real relations of objects, proves
also that such a scheme can hardly be permanent in
its original form, but will almost inevitably become
imperfect and anomalous, in consequence of the accumulation
of new facts, and the introduction of new
generalizations. Still, we may venture to say that
such a scheme does not, on this account, become worthless;
for it not only answers its purpose in the stage of
scientific progress to which it belongs:&mdash;so far as it is
not erroneous, or merely conventional, but really systematic
and significant of truth, its terms can be translated at once
into the language of any higher generalization which is
afterwards arrived at. If terms express <span class="pagenum" id="page277">277</span> relations
really ascertained to be true, they can never
lose their value by any change of the received theory.
They are like coins of pure metal, which, even when
carried into a country which does not recognize the
sovereign whose impress they bear, are still gladly
received, and may, by the addition of an explanatory
mark, continue part of the common currency of the
country.</p>
<p>These two great instances of the reform of scientific
language, in Botany and in Chemistry, are much the
most important and instructive events of this kind
which the history of science offers. It is not necessary
to pursue our historical survey further. Our remaining
Aphorisms respecting the Language of Science
will be collected and illustrated indiscriminately, from
the precepts and the examples of preceding philosophers
of all periods<a id="fnanchor16-4" href="#note16-4"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-4" href="#fnanchor16-4">16</a></span>
See at the <a href="#page346">end</a> of these Aphorisms, further illustrations
of them from the recent history of Comparative Anatomy and Chemistry.
</div>
<p>We may, however, remark that Aphorisms III., IV.,
V., VI., VII., respect peculiarly the Formation of
Technical Terms by the Appropriation of Common
Words, while the remaining ones apply to the Formation of New Terms.</p>
<p class="end">It does not appear possible to lay down a system of
rules which may determine and regulate the construction
of all technical terms, on all the occasions on
which the progress of science makes them necessary or
convenient. But if we can collect a few maxims such
as have already offered themselves to the minds of
philosophers, or such as may be justified by the instances
by which we shall illustrate them, these maxims may
avail to guide us in doubtful cases, and to prevent our
aiming at advantages which are unattainable, or being
disturbed by seeming imperfections which are really
no evils. I shall therefore state such maxims of this
kind as seem most sound and useful. <span class="pagenum" id="page278">278</span></p>
<p class="center" id="a3"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> III.</p>
<p><i>In framing scientific terms, the appropriation of old
words is preferable to the invention of new ones.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> maxim is stated by Bacon in his usual striking
manner. After mentioning <i>Metaphysic</i>, as one of the
divisions of Natural Philosophy, he
adds<a id="fnanchor17-4" href="#note17-4"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>: ‘Wherein
I desire it may be conceived that I use the word <i>metaphysic</i>
in a different sense from that that is received:
and in like manner I doubt not but it will easily
appear to men of judgment that in this and other particulars,
wheresoever my conception and notion may
differ from the ancient, yet I am studious to keep the
ancient terms. For, hoping well to deliver myself from
mistaking by the order and perspicuous expressing of
that I do propound; I am otherwise zealous and affectionate
to recede as little from antiquity, either in
terms or opinions, as may stand with truth, and the
proficience of knowledge, . . . To me, that do desire,
as much as lieth in my pen, to ground a sociable intercourse
between antiquity and proficience, it seemeth
best to keep a way with antiquity <i>usque ad aras</i>; and
therefore to retain the ancient terms, though I sometimes
alter the uses and definitions; according to the
moderate proceeding in civil governments, when,
although there be some alteration, yet that holdeth
which Tacitus wisely noteth, <i>eadem magistratuum
vocabula</i>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-4" href="#fnanchor17-4">17</a></span>
<i>De Augm.</i> lib. iii. c. iv.
</div>
<p>We have had before us a sufficient number of examples of
scientific terms thus framed; for they formed
the first of three classes which we described in the
First Aphorism. And we may again remark, that
science, when she thus adopts terms which are in common
use, always limits and fixes their meaning in
a technical manner. We may also repeat here the
warning already given respecting terms of this kind,
that they are peculiarly liable to mislead readers who <span class="pagenum" id="page279">279</span>
do not take care to understand them in their technical
instead of their common signification. <i>Force</i>, <i>momentum</i>,
<i>inertia</i>, <i>impetus</i>, <i>vis viva</i>, are terms which are
very useful, if we rigorously bear in mind the import
which belongs to each of them in the best treatises on
Mechanics; but if the reader content himself with
conjecturing their meaning from the context, his
knowledge will be confused and worthless.</p>
<p class="end">In the application of this Third Aphorism, other
rules are to be attended to, which I add.</p>
<p class="center" id="a4"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> IV.</p>
<p><i>When common words are appropriated as technical terms,
their meaning and relations in common use should be retained
as far as can conveniently be done.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">I will</span> state an example in which this rule seems to
be applicable. Mr Davies
Gilbert<a id="fnanchor18-4" href="#note18-4"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>
has recently proposed
the term <i>efficiency</i> to designate the work which
a machine, according to the force exerted upon it, is
capable of doing; the work being measured by the
weight raised, and the space through which it is raised,
jointly. The usual term employed among engineers
for the work which a machine actually does, measured
in the way just stated, is <i>duty</i>. But as there appears
to be a little incongruity in calling that work <i>efficiency</i>
which the machine <em>ought</em> to do, when we call that
work <i>duty</i> which it really does, I have proposed to
term these two quantities <i>theoretical efficiency</i> and
<i>practical efficiency</i>, or <i>theoretical duty</i> and <i>practical
duty</i><a id="fnanchor19-4" href="#note19-4"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-4" href="#fnanchor18-4">18</a></span>
<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1827, p. 25.
</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-4" href="#fnanchor19-4">19</a></span>
The term <i>travail</i> is used by French engineers,
to express <i>efficiency</i> or <i>theoretical duty</i>. This term
has been rendered in English by <i>labouring force</i>.
</div>
<p class="end">Since common words are often vague in their meaning, I add as
a necessary accompaniment to the Third
Aphorism the following:&mdash; <span class="pagenum" id="page280">280</span></p>
<p class="center" id="a5"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> V.</p>
<p><i>When common words are appropriated as technical terms,
their meaning may be modified, and must be rigorously fixed.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> is stated by Bacon in the above extract: ‘to
retain the ancient terms, though I sometimes <i>alter the
uses and definitions</i>.’ The scientific use of the term is
in all cases much more precise than the common use.
The loose notions of <i>velocity</i> and <i>force</i> for instance,
which are sufficient for the usual purposes of language,
require to be fixed by exact measures when these are
made terms in the science of Mechanics.</p>
<p>This scientific fixation of the meaning of words is to
be looked upon as a matter of convention, although it
is in reality often an inevitable result of the progress
of science. <i>Momentum</i> is conventionally defined to be
the product of the numbers expressing the weight and
the velocity; but then, it could be of no use in expressing
the laws of motion if it were defined otherwise.</p>
<p>Hence it is no valid objection to a scientific term
that the word in common language does not mean
exactly the same as in its common use. It is no
sufficient reason against the use of the term <i>acid</i> for a
class of bodies, that all the substances belonging to
this class are not sour. We have seen that a <i>trapezium</i>
is used in geometry for any four-sided figure,
though originally it meant a figure with two opposite
sides parallel and the two others equal. A certain
stratum which lies below the chalk is termed by
English geologists <i>the green sand</i>. It has sometimes
been objected to this denomination that the stratum
has very frequently no tinge of green, and that it is
often composed of lime with little or no sand. Yet
the term is a good technical term in spite of these
apparent improprieties; so long as it is carefully
applied to that stratum which is geologically equivalent
to the greenish sandy bed to which the appellation was
originally applied.</p>
<p>When it appeared that <i>geometry</i> would have to be
employed as much at least about the heavens as the
earth, Plato exclaimed against the folly of calling the <span class="pagenum" id="page281">281</span>
science by such a name; since the word signifies
‘earth-measuring;’ yet the word <i>geometry</i> has retained
its place and answered its purpose perfectly well up to
the present day.</p>
<p>But though the meaning of the term may be modified or
extended, it must be rigorously fixed when it is
appropriated to science. This process is most abundantly
exemplified by the terminology of Natural History,
and especially of Botany, in which each term has
a most precise meaning assigned to it. Thus Linnæus
established exact distinctions between <i>fasciculus</i>,
<i>capitulum</i>, <i>racemus</i>, <i>thyrsus</i>, <i>paniculus</i>, <i>spica</i>, <i>amentum</i>,
<i>corymbus</i>, <i>umbella</i>, <i>cyma</i>, <i>verticillus</i>; or, in the language
of English Botanists, <i>a tuft</i>, <i>a head</i>, <i>a cluster</i>, <i>a
bunch</i>, <i>a panicle</i>, <i>a spike</i>, <i>a catkin</i>, <i>a corymb</i>, <i>an umbel</i>,
<i>a cyme</i>, <i>a whorl</i>. And it has since been laid down as
a rule<a id="fnanchor20-4" href="#note20-4"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>,
that each organ ought to have a separate and
appropriate name; so that the term <i>leaf</i>, for instance,
shall never be applied to <i>a leaflet</i>, <i>a bractea</i>, or <i>a sepal</i>
of the calyx.</p>

</div>
<p>Botanists have not been content with fixing the
meaning of their terms by verbal definition, but have
also illustrated them by figures, which address the eye.
Of these, as excellent modern examples, may be mentioned
those which occur in the works of
Mirbel<a id="fnanchor21-4" href="#note21-4"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>, and
Lindley<a id="fnanchor22-4" href="#note22-4"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> VI.</p>
<p><i>When common words are appropriated as technical terms,
this must be done so that they are not ambiguous in their
application.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">An</span> example will explain this maxim. The conditions
of a body, as a solid, a liquid, and an air, have
been distinguished as different <i>forms</i> of the body. But
the word <i>form</i>, as applied to bodies, has other
meanings; so that if we were to inquire in <i>what form</i>
water exists in a snow-cloud, it might be doubted
whether the forms of crystallization were meant, or <span class="pagenum" id="page282">282</span>
the different forms of ice, water, and vapour. Hence
I have proposed<a id="fnanchor23-4" href="#note23-4"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>
to reject the term <i>form</i> in such cases,
and to speak of the different <i>consistence</i> of a body in
these conditions. The term <i>consistence</i> is usually
applied to conditions between solid and fluid; and may
without effort be extended to those limiting conditions.
And though it may appear more harsh to extend the
term <i>consistence</i> to the state of air, it may be justified
by what has been said in speaking of Aphorism V.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-4" href="#fnanchor23-4">23</a></span>
<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. x. c. ii. sect. 2.
</div>
<p>I may notice another example of the necessity of
avoiding ambiguous words. A philosopher who makes
method his study, would naturally be termed a <i>methodist</i>;
but unluckily this word is already appropriated
to a religious sect: and hence we could hardly venture
to speak of Cæsalpinus, Ray, Morison, Rivinus,
Tournefort, Linnæus, and their successors, as <i>botanical
methodists</i>. Again, by this maxim, we are almost
debarred from using the term <i>physician</i> for a cultivator of
the science of physics, because it already signifies a
practiser of physic. We might, perhaps, still use <i>physician</i>
as the equivalent of the French <i>physicien</i>, in
virtue of Aphorism V.; but probably it would be better
to form a new word. Thus we may say, that while
the Naturalist employs principally the ideas of resemblance
and life, the <i>Physicist</i> proceeds upon the ideas
of force, matter, and the properties of matter.</p>
<p class="end">Whatever may be thought of this proposal, the
maxim which it implies is frequently useful. It is
this.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> VII.</p>
<p><i>It is better to form new words as technical terms, than to
employ old ones in which the last three Aphorisms cannot be
complied with.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> principal inconvenience attending the
employment of new words constructed expressly for the use
of science, is the difficulty of effectually introducing
them. Readers will not readily take the trouble to
learn the meaning of a word, in which the memory is <span class="pagenum" id="page283">283</span>
not assisted by some obvious suggestion connected with
the common use of language. When this difficulty is
overcome, the new word is better than one merely appropriated;
since it is more secure from vagueness and
confusion. And in cases where the inconveniences
belonging to a scientific use of common words become
great and inevitable, a new word must be framed and
introduced.</p>
<p>The Maxims which belong to the construction of
such words will be stated hereafter; but I may notice
an instance or two tending to show the necessity of
the Maxim now before us.</p>
<p>The word <i>Force</i> has been appropriated in the science
of Mechanics in two senses: as indicating the cause of
motion; and again, as expressing certain measures of
the effects of this cause, in the phrases <i>accelerating
force</i> and <i>moving force</i>. Hence we might have occasion
to speak of the accelerating or moving force <i>of</i> a
certain <i>force</i>; for instance, if we were to say that the
force which governs the motions of the planets resides
in the sun; and that the accelerating force <i>of</i> this <i>force</i>
varies only with the distance, but its moving force
varies as the product of the mass of the sun and the
planet. This is a harsh and incongruous mode of expression;
and might have been avoided, if, instead of
<i>accelerating force</i> and <i>moving force</i>, single abstract
terms had been introduced by Newton: if, for instance,
he had said that the velocity generated in a
second measures the <i>accelerativity</i> of the force which
produces it, and the momentum produced in a second
measures the <i>motivity</i> of the force.</p>
<p>The science which treats of heat has hitherto had no
special designation: treatises upon it have generally
been termed treatises <i>On Heat</i>. But this practice of
employing the same term to denote the property and
the science which treats of it, is awkward, and often
ambiguous. And it is further attended with this
inconvenience, that we have no adjective derived from
the name of the science, as we have in other cases,
when we speak of <i>acoustical</i> experiments and <i>optical</i>
theories. This inconvenience has led various persons
to suggest names for the Science of Heat. M. Comte <span class="pagenum" id="page284">284</span>
terms it <i>Thermology</i>. In the <i>History of the Sciences</i>,
I have named it <i>Thermotics</i>, which appears to me to
agree better with the analogy of the names of other
corresponding sciences, <i>Acoustics</i> and <i>Optics</i>.
<i>Electricity</i> is in the same condition as Heat; having
only one word to express the property and the science.
M. Le Comte proposes <i>Electrology</i>: for the same reason
as before, I should conceive <i>Electrics</i> more agreeable to
analogy. The coincidence of the word with the plural
of Electric would not give rise to ambiguity; for <i>Electrics</i>,
taken as the name of a science, would be singular,
like <i>Optics</i> and <i>Mechanics</i>. But a term offers itself to
express <i>common</i> or <i>machine Electrics</i>, which appears
worthy of admission, though involving a theoretical
view. The received doctrine of the difference between
Voltaic and Common Electricity is, that in the former
case the fluid must be considered as in motion, in the
latter as at rest. The science which treats of the former
class of subjects is commonly termed <i>Electrodynamics</i>,
which obviously suggests the name <i>Electrostatics</i> for the latter.</p>
<p>The subject of the Tides is, in like manner, destitute
of any name which designates the science concerned
about it. I have ventured to employ the term <i>Tidology</i>,
having been much engaged in tidological researches.</p>
<p>Many persons possess a peculiarity of vision, which
disables them from distinguishing certain colours. On
examining many such cases, we find that in all such
persons the peculiarities are the same; all of them
confounding scarlet with green, and pink with blue.
Hence they form a class, which, for the convenience of
physiologists and others, ought to have a fixed designation.
Instead of calling them, as has usually been
done, ‘persons having a peculiarity of vision,’ we might
take a Greek term implying this meaning, and term
them <i>Idiopts</i>.</p>
<p class="end">But my business at present is not to speak of the
selection of new terms when they are introduced, but
to illustrate the maxim that the necessity for their
introduction often arises. The construction of new terms
will be treated of subsequently. <span class="pagenum" id="page285">285</span></p>
<p class="center" id="a8"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> VIII.</p>
<p><i>Terms must be constructed and appropriated so as to be
fitted to enunciate simply and clearly true general propositions.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> Aphorism may be considered as the fundamental
principle and supreme rule of all scientific terminology.
It is asserted by Cuvier, speaking of a particular case.
Thus he says<a id="fnanchor24-4" href="#note24-4"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>
of Gmelin, that by placing
the lamantin in the genus of morses, and the siren in
the genus of eels, he had rendered every general proposition
respecting the organization of those genera
impossible.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-4" href="#fnanchor24-4">24</a></span>
<i>Règne Animal</i>, Introd. viii.
</div>
<p>The maxim is true of words appropriated as well
as invented, and applies equally to the mathematical,
chemical, and classificatory sciences. With regard to
most of these, and especially the two former classes, it
has been abundantly exemplified already, in what has
previously been said, and in the <i>History of the Sciences</i>.
For we have there had to notice many technical terms,
with the occasions of their introduction; and all these
occasions have involved the intention of expressing in
a convenient manner some truth or supposed truth.
The terms of Astronomy were adopted for the purpose
of stating and reasoning upon the relations of the
celestial motions, according to the doctrine of the sphere,
and the other laws which were discovered by astronomers.
The few technical terms which belong to Mechanics,
<i>force</i>, <i>velocity</i>, <i>momentum</i>, <i>inertia</i>, &amp;c., were
employed from the first with a view to the expression
of the laws of motion and of rest; and were, in the
end, limited so as truly and simply to express those
laws when they were fully ascertained. In Chemistry,
the term <i>phlogiston</i> was useful, as has been shown in
the <i>History</i>, in classing together processes which really
are of the same nature; and the nomenclature of the
<i>oxygen</i> theory was still preferable, because it enabled
the chemist to express a still greater number of general truths. <span class="pagenum" id="page286">286</span></p>
<p>To the connexion here asserted, of theory and nomenclature,
we have the testimony of the author of
the oxygen theory. In the Preface to his <i>Chemistry</i>,
Lavoisier says:&mdash;‘Thus while I thought myself employed
only in forming a Nomenclature, and while I
proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the
chemical language, my work transformed itself by degrees,
without my being able to prevent it, into a
Treatise on the Elements of Chemistry.’ And he then
proceeds to show how this happened.</p>
<p>It is, however, mainly through the progress of Natural
History in modern times, that philosophers have
been led to see the importance and necessity of new
terms in expressing new truths. Thus Harvey, in the
Preface to his work on Generation, says:&mdash;‘Be not
offended if in setting out the History of the Egg I
make use of a new method, and sometimes of unusual
terms. For as they which find out a new plantation
and new shores call them by names of their own coining,
which posterity afterwards accepts and receives,
so those that find out new secrets have good title to
their compellation. And here, methinks, I hear Galen
advising: If we consent in the things, contend not
about the words.’</p>
<p>The Nomenclature which answers the purposes of
Natural History is a Systematic Nomenclature, and
will be further considered under the next Aphorism.
But we may remark, that the Aphorism now before
us governs the use of words, not in science only, but
in common language also. Are we to apply the name
<i>fish</i> to animals of the whale kind? The answer is
determined by our present rule: we are to do so, or not,
accordingly as we can best express true propositions.
If we are speaking of the internal structure and physiology
of the animal, we must not call them <i>fish</i>; for
in these respects they deviate widely from fishes: they
have warm blood, and produce and suckle their young
as land quadrupeds do. But this would not prevent
our speaking of the <i>whale-fishery</i>, and calling such
animals <i>fish</i> on all occasions connected with this employment;
for the relations thus arising depend upon the
animal’s living in the water, and being caught in a <span class="pagenum" id="page287">287</span>
manner similar to other fishes. A plea that human
laws which mention fish do not apply to whales, would
be rejected at once by an intelligent judge.</p>
<p>[A bituminiferous deposit which occurs amongst the
coal measures in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh was
used as coal, and called ‘Boghead Cannel Coal.’ But
a lawsuit arose upon the question whether this, which
geologically was not <i>the coal</i>, should be regarded in
law as <i>coal</i>. The opinions of chemists and geologists,
as well as of lawyers, were discrepant, and a direct
decision of the case was evaded.<a id="fnanchor25-4" href="#note25-4"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>]</p>

<p class="center" id="a9"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> IX.</p>
<p><i>In the Classificatory Sciences, a Systematic Nomenclature
is necessary; and the System and the Nomenclature are
each essential to the utility of the other.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> inconveniences arising from the want of a good
Nomenclature were long felt in Botany, and are still
felt in Mineralogy. The attempts to remedy them by
<i>Synonymies</i> are very ineffective, for such comparisons of
synonyms do not supply a systematic nomenclature;
and such a one alone can enable us to state general
truths respecting the objects of which the classificatory
sciences treat. The <i>System</i> and the <i>Names</i> ought to
be introduced together; for the former is a collection
of asserted analogies and resemblances, for which
the latter provide simple and permanent expressions.
Hence it has repeatedly occurred in the progress of
Natural History, that good Systems did not take root,
or produce any lasting effect among naturalists, because
they were not accompanied by a corresponding Nomenclature.
In this way, as we have already noticed,
the excellent botanical System of Cæsalpinus was
without immediate effect upon the science. The work
of Willoughby, as Cuvier
says<a id="fnanchor26-4" href="#note26-4"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>,
forms an epoch, and <span class="pagenum" id="page288">288</span>
a happy epoch in Ichthyology; yet because Willoughby
had no Nomenclature of his own, and no fixed names
for his genera, his immediate influence was not great.
Again, in speaking of Schlotheim’s work containing
representations of fossil vegetables, M. Adolphe Brongniart
observes<a id="fnanchor27-4" href="#note27-4"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>
that the figures and descriptions are
so good, that if the author had established a
nomenclature for the objects he describes, his work would
have become the basis of all succeeding labours on
the subject.</p>

</div>
<p>As additional examples of cases in which the improvement
of classification, in recent times, has led
philosophers to propose new names, I may mention
the term <i>Pœcilite</i>, proposed by Mr. Conybeare
to designate the group of strata which lies below the oolites
and lias, including the new red or variegated sandstone,
with the keuper above, and the magnesian limestone below it.
Again, the transition districts of our
island have recently been reduced to system by Professor
Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison; and this step has
been marked by the terms <i>Cambrian</i> system, and
<i>Silurian</i> system, applied to the two great groups of
formations which they have respectively examined,
and by several other names of the subordinate members of these formations.</p>
<p>Thus System and Nomenclature are each essential
to the other. Without Nomenclature, the system is
not permanently incorporated into the general body of
knowledge, and made an instrument of future progress.
Without System, the names cannot express general
truths, and contain no reason why they should be
employed in preference to any other names.</p>
<p>This has been generally acknowledged by the most
philosophical naturalists of modern times. Thus
Linnæus begins that part of his Botanical Philosophy in
which names are treated of, by stating that the
foundation of botany is twofold, <i>Disposition</i> and
<i>Denomination</i>; and he adds this Latin line,</p>
<p class="eq center"><span class="medium">Nomina si nescis perit et cognitio rerum.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="page289">289</span></p>
<p class="eq noind">And Cuvier, in the Preface to his <i>Animal Kingdom</i>,
explains, in a very striking manner, how the attempt
to connect zoology with anatomy led him, at the same
time, to reform the classifications, and to correct the
nomenclature of preceding zoologists.</p>
<p>I have stated that in Mineralogy we are still destitute
of a good nomenclature generally current. From
what has now been said, it will be seen that it may
be very far from easy to supply this defect, since we
have, as yet, no generally received system of mineralogical
classification. Till we know what are really
different species of minerals, and in what larger
groups these species can be arranged, so as to have
common properties, we shall never obtain a permanent
mineralogical nomenclature. Thus <i>Leucocyclite</i> and
<i>Tesselite</i> are minerals previously confounded with
Apophyllite, which Sir John Herschel and Sir David
Brewster distinguished by those names, in consequence
of certain optical properties which they exhibit. But
are these properties definite distinctions? and are
there any external differences corresponding to them?
If not, can we consider them as separate species? and
if not separate species, ought they to have separate
names? In like manner, we might ask if <i>Augite</i> and
<i>Hornblende</i> are really the same species, as Gustavus
Rose has maintained? if <i>Diallage</i> and <i>Hypersthene</i> are
not definitely distinguished, which has been asserted
by Kobell? Till such questions are settled, we cannot
have a fixed nomenclature in mineralogy. What
appears the best course to follow in the present state
of the science, I shall consider when we come to speak
of the form of technical terms.</p>
<p class="end">I may, however, notice here that the main Forms
of systematic nomenclature are two:&mdash;terms which
are produced by combining words of higher and lower
generality, as the binary names, consisting of the name
of the genus and the species, generally employed by
natural historians since the time of Linnæus;&mdash;and
terms in which some relation of things is indicated by
a change in the form of the word, for example, an
alteration of its termination, of which kind of <span class="pagenum" id="page290">290</span>
nomenclature we have a conspicuous example in the modern
chemistry.</p>
<p class="center" id="a10"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> X.</p>
<p><i>New terms and changes of terms, which are not needed in
order to express truth, are to be avoided.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">As</span> the Seventh Aphorism asserted that novelties
in language may be and ought to be introduced, when
they aid the enunciation of truths, we now declare
that they are not admissible in any other case. New
terms and new systems of terms are not to be introduced,
for example, in virtue of their own neatness or
symmetry, or other merits, if there is no occasion for
their use.</p>
<p>I may mention, as an old example of a superfluous
attempt of this kind, an occurrence in the history of
Astronomy. In 1628 John Bayer and Julius Schiller
devised a <i>Cœlum Christianum</i>, in which the common
names of the planets, &amp;c., were replaced by those of
Adam, Moses, and the Patriarchs. The twelve Signs
became the twelve Apostles, and the constellations
became sacred places and things. Peireskius, who had
to pronounce upon the value of this proposal, praised
the piety of the inventors, but did not approve, he
said<a id="fnanchor28-4" href="#note28-4"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>,
the design of perverting and confounding
whatever of celestial information from the period of the
earliest memory is found in books.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-4" href="#fnanchor28-4">28</a></span>
Gassendi, <i>Vita Peireskii</i>, 300.
</div>
<p>Nor are slight anomalies in the existing language of
science sufficient ground for a change, if they do not
seriously interfere with the expression of our knowledge.
Thus Linnæus says<a id="fnanchor29-4" href="#note29-4"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>
that a fair generic name
is not to be exchanged for another though apter one:
and<a id="fnanchor30-4" href="#note30-4"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a>
if we separate an old genus into several, we
must try to find names for them among the synonyms
which describe the old genus. This maxim excludes
the restoration of ancient names long disused, no less
than the needless invention of new ones. Linnæus <span class="pagenum" id="page291">291</span>
lays down this rule<a id="fnanchor31-4" href="#note31-4"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>;
and adds, that the botanists of
the sixteenth century well nigh ruined botany by their
anxiety to recover the ancient names of plants. In
like manner Cuvier<a id="fnanchor32-4" href="#note32-4"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>
laments it as a misfortune, that
he has had to introduce many new names; and declares
earnestly that he has taken great pains to preserve
those of his predecessors.</p>

<p>The great bulk which the Synonymy of botany and
of mineralogy have attained, shows us that this maxim
has not been universally attended to. In these cases,
however, the multiplication of different names for the
same kind of object has arisen in general from ignorance
of the identity of it under different circumstances,
or from the want of a system which might assign to
it its proper place. But there are other instances, in
which the multiplication of names has arisen not from
defect, but from excess, of the spirit of system. The
love which speculative men bear towards symmetry
and completeness is constantly at work, to make them
create systems of classification more regular and more
perfect than can be verified by the facts: and as good
systems are closely connected with a good nomenclature,
systems thus erroneous and superfluous lead to
a nomenclature which is prejudicial to science. For
although such a nomenclature is finally expelled, when
it is found not to aid us in expressing the true laws
of nature, it may obtain some temporary sway, during
which, and even afterwards, it may be a source of
much confusion.</p>
<p>We have a conspicuous example of such a result in
the geological nomenclature of Werner and his school.
Thus it was assumed, in Werner’s system, that his
<i>First</i>, <i>Second</i>, and <i>Third Flötz Limestone</i>, his <i>Old</i> and
<i>New Red Sandstone</i>, were universal formations; and
geologists looked upon it as their business to detect
these strata in other countries. Names were thus
assigned to the rocks of various parts of Europe, which
created immense perplexity before they were again
ejected. The geological terms which now prevail, for <span class="pagenum" id="page292">292</span>
instance, those of Smith, are for the most part not
systematic, but are borrowed from accidents, as localities,
or popular names; as <i>Oxford Clay</i> and <i>Cornbrash</i>;
and hence they are not liable to be thrust out
on a change of system. On the other hand we do not
find sufficient reason to accept the system of names of
strata proposed by Mr. Conybeare in the <i>Introduction
to the Geology of England and Wales</i>, according to
which the <i>Carboniferous Rocks</i> are the <i>Medial Order</i>,&mdash;having
above them the <i>Supermedial Order</i> (<i>New Red
Sand</i>, <i>Oolites</i> and <i>Chalk</i>), and above these the
<i>Superior Order</i> (<i>Tertiary Rocks</i>); and again,&mdash;having
below, the <i>Submedial Order</i> (the <i>Transition Rocks</i>),
and the <i>Inferior Order</i> (<i>Mica Slate</i>, <i>Gneiss</i>, <i>Granite</i>).
For though these names have long been proposed, it
does not appear that they are useful in enunciating
geological truths. We may, it would seem, pronounce
the same judgment respecting the system of geological
names proposed by M. Alexander Brongniart, in his
<i>Tableau des Terrains qui composent l’écorce du Globe</i>.
He divides these strata into nine classes, which he
terms <i>Terrains Alluviens</i>, <i>Lysiens</i>, <i>Pyrogenes</i>, <i>Clysmiens</i>,
<i>Yzemiens</i>, <i>Hemilysiens</i>, <i>Agalysiens</i>, <i>Plutoniques</i>,
<i>Vulcaniques</i>. These classes are again variously subdivided:
thus the Terrains Yzemiens are <i>Thalassiques</i>,
<i>Pelagiques</i>, and <i>Abyssiques</i>; and the Abyssiques are
subdivided into <i>Lias</i>, <i>Keuper</i>, <i>Conchiliens</i>, <i>Pœciliens</i>,
<i>Peneens</i>, <i>Rudimentaires</i>, <i>Entritiques</i>, <i>Houillers</i>,
<i>Carbonifers</i> and <i>Gres Rouge Ancien</i>. Scarcely any amount
of new truths would induce geologists to burthen
themselves at once with this enormous system of new
names: but in fact, it is evident that any portion of
truth, which any author can have brought to light,
may be conveyed by means of a much simpler apparatus.
Such a nomenclature carries its condemnation
on its own face.</p>
<p>Nearly the same may be said of the systematic nomenclature
proposed for mineralogy by Professor Mohs.
Even if all his Genera be really natural groups,
(a doctrine which we can have no confidence in till they are
confirmed by the evidence of chemistry,) there is no <span class="pagenum" id="page293">293</span>
necessity to make so great a change in the received
names of minerals. His proceeding in this respect, so
different from the temperance of Linnæus and Cuvier,
has probably ensured a speedy oblivion to this part of
his system. In crystallography, on the other hand, in
which Mohs’s improvements have been very valuable,
there are several terms introduced by him, as <i>rhombohedron</i>,
<i>scalenohedron</i>, <i>hemihedral</i>, <i>systems</i> of
crystallization, which will probably be a permanent portion of
the language of science.</p>
<p>I may remark, in general, that the only persons who
succeed in making great alterations in the language of
science, are not those who make names arbitrarily and
as an exercise of ingenuity, but those who have much
new knowledge to communicate; so that the vehicle is
commended to general reception by the value of what
it contains. It is only eminent discoverers to whom
the authority is conceded of introducing a new system
of names; just as it is only the highest authority in the
state which has the power of putting a new coinage in
circulation.</p>
<p>I will here quote some judicious remarks of Mr.
Howard, which fall partly under this Aphorism, and
partly under some which follow. He had proposed, as
names for the kinds of clouds, the following: <i>Cirrus</i>,
<i>Cirrocumulus</i>, <i>Cirrostratus</i>, <i>Cumulostratus</i>, <i>Cumulus</i>,
<i>Nimbus</i>, <i>Stratus</i>. In an abridgment of his views, given
in the Supplement to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
English names were proposed as the equivalents of these;
<i>Curlcloud</i>, <i>Sondercloud</i>, <i>Wanecloud</i>, <i>Twaincloud</i>,
<i>Stackencloud</i>, <i>Raincloud</i>, <i>Fallcloud</i>.
Upon these Mr. Howard observes: ‘I mention these, in order
to have the opportunity of saying that I do not adopt them.
The names for the clouds which I deduced from the Latin,
are but seven in number, and very easy to remember.
They were intended as <em>arbitrary terms</em> for the <em>structure</em>
of clouds, and the meaning of them was carefully fixed
by a definition. The observer having once made himself
master of this, was able to apply the term with
correctness, after a little experience, to the subject
under all its varieties of form, colour, or position. The <span class="pagenum" id="page294">294</span>
new names, if meant to be another set of arbitrary
terms, are superfluous; if intended to convey in themselves
an explanation in English, they fail in this, by
applying to some part or circumstance only of the definition;
the <em>whole</em> of which must be kept in view to
study the subject with success. To take for an example
the first of the modifications. The term <i>cirrus</i>
very readily takes an abstract meaning, equally applicable
to the rectilinear as to the flexuous forms of the
subject. But the name of <i>curl-cloud</i> will not, without
some violence to its <em>obvious sense</em>, acquire this more
extensive one: and will therefore be apt to mislead the
reader rather than further his progress. Others of
these names are as devoid of a meaning obvious to the
English reader, as the Latin terms themselves. But
the principal objection to English or any other local
terms, remains to be stated. They take away from
the nomenclature its general advantage of constituting,
as far as it goes, an universal language, by means
of which the intelligent of every country may convey
to each other their ideas without the necessity of
translation.’</p>
<p class="end">I here adduce these as examples of the arguments
against changing an established nomenclature. As
grounds of selecting a new one, they may be taken
into account hereafter.</p>
<p class="center" id="a11"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XI.</p>
<p><i>Terms which imply theoretical views are admissible, as
far as the theory is proved.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is not unfrequently stated that the circumstances
from which the names employed in science borrow their
meaning, ought to be facts and not theories. But such
a recommendation implies a belief that facts are rigorously
distinguished from theories and directly opposed
to them; which belief, we have repeatedly seen, is unfounded.
When theories are firmly established, they
become facts; and names founded on such theoretical
views are unexceptionable. If we speak of the <i>minor</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page295">295</span>
<i>axis</i> of Jupiter’s <i>orbit</i>, or of his <i>density</i>, or of <i>the angle
of refraction</i>, or <i>the length of an undulation</i> of red
light, we assume certain theories; but inasmuch as the
theories are now the inevitable interpretation of ascertained
facts, we can have no better terms to designate
the conceptions thus referred to. And hence the rule
which we must follow is, not that our terms must
involve no theory, but that they imply the theory only
in that sense in which it is the interpretation of the
facts.</p>
<p>For example, the term <i>polarization</i> of light was
objected to, as involving a theory. Perhaps the term
was at first suggested by conceiving light to consist of
particles having poles turned in a particular manner.
But among intelligent speculators, the notion of
polarization soon reduced itself to the simple conception of
opposite properties in opposite positions, which is a bare
statement of the fact: and the term being understood
to have this meaning, is a perfectly good term, and
indeed the best which we can imagine for designating
what is intended.</p>
<p>I need hardly add the caution, that names involving
theoretical views not in accordance with facts are to be
rejected. The following instances exemplify both the
positive and the negative application of this maxim.</p>
<p>The distinction of <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> rocks in
geology was founded upon a theory; namely, that those
which do not contain any organic remains were first
deposited, and afterwards, those which contain plants
and animals. But this theory was insecure from the
first. The difficulty of making the separation which
it implied, led to the introduction of a class of <i>transition</i>
rocks. And the recent researches of geologists lead
them to the conclusion, that those rocks which are
termed <i>primary</i>, may be the newest, not the oldest,
productions of nature.</p>
<p>In order to avoid this incongruity, other terms have
been proposed as substitutes for these. Sir C. Lyell
remarks<a id="fnanchor33-4" href="#note33-4"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>,
that granite, gneiss, and the like, form a class <span class="pagenum" id="page296">296</span>
which should be designated by a common name; which
name should not be of chronological import. He proposes
<i>hypogene</i>, signifying ‘nether-formed;’ and thus
he adopts the theory that they have not assumed their
present form and structure at the surface, but determines
nothing of the period when they were produced.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-4" href="#fnanchor33-4">33</a></span>
<i>Princ. Geol.</i> iv. 386.
</div>
<p>These hypogene rocks, again, he divides into unstratified
or <i>plutonic</i>, and altered stratified, or <i>metamorphic</i>;
the latter term implying the hypothesis that the stratified
rocks to which it is applied have been altered, by
the effect of fire or otherwise, since they were deposited.
That fossiliferous strata, in some cases at least, have
undergone such a change, is demonstrable from
facts<a id="fnanchor34-4" href="#note34-4"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-4" href="#fnanchor34-4">34</a></span>
<i>Elem. Geol.</i> p. 17.
</div>
<p>The modern nomenclature of chemistry implies the
oxygen theory of chemistry. Hence it has sometimes
been objected to. Thus Davy, in speaking of the
Lavoisierian nomenclature, makes the following remarks,
which, however plausible they may sound, will
be found to be utterly
erroneous<a id="fnanchor35-4" href="#note35-4"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>.
‘Simplicity and
precision ought to be the characteristics of a scientific
nomenclature: words should signify <em>things</em>, or the <em>analogies</em> of
things, and not <em>opinions</em>.... A substance in one age
supposed to be simple, in another is proved to be compound,
and <i>vice versâ</i>. A theoretical nomenclature is liable
to continual alterations: <i>oxygenated muriatic acid</i> is
as improper a term as <i>dephlogisticated marine acid</i>.
Every school believes itself to be in the right: and if
every school assumes to itself the liberty of altering
the names of chemical substances in consequence of
<em>new ideas</em> of their composition, there can be no permanency
in the language of the science; it must always
be confused and uncertain. Bodies which are <em>similar</em>
to each other should always be classed together; and
there is a presumption that their composition is <em>analogous</em>.
<i>Metals</i>, <i>earths</i>, <i>alkalis</i>, are appropriate names
for the bodies they represent, and independent of all
speculation: whereas <i>oxides</i>, <i>sulphurets</i>, and <i>muriates</i>
are terms founded upon opinions of the composition of
bodies, some of which have been already found erroneous. <span class="pagenum" id="page297">297</span>
The least dangerous mode of giving a systematic form
to a language seems to be to signify the analogies of
substances by some common sign affixed to the beginning
or the termination of the word. Thus as the
metals have been distinguished by a termination in
<i>um</i>, as <i>aurum</i>, so their calciform or oxidated state
might have been denoted by a termination in <i>a</i>, as
<i>aura</i>: and no progress, however great, in the science
could render it necessary that such a mode of appellation should be changed.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-4" href="#fnanchor35-4">35</a></span>
<i>Elements of Chem. Phil.</i> p. 46.
</div>
<p>These remarks are founded upon distinctions which
have no real existence. We cannot separate <em>things</em>
from their <em>properties</em>, nor can we consider their properties
and analogies in any other way than by having
<em>opinions</em> about them. By contrasting <em>analogies</em> with
<em>opinions</em>, it might appear as if the author maintained
that there were certain analogies about which there
was no room for erroneous opinions. Yet the analogies
of chemical compounds, are, in fact, those points
which have been most the subject of difference of opinion,
and on which the revolutions of theories have
most changed men’s views. As an example of analogies which
are still recognized under alterations of
theory, the writer gives the relation of a metal to its
oxide or calciform state. But this analogy of metallic
oxides, as Red Copper or Iron Ore, to Calx, or burnt
lime, is very far from being self-evident;&mdash;so far indeed,
that the recognition of the analogy was a great
step in chemical <em>theory</em>. The terms which he quotes,
<i>oxygenated muriatic acid</i> (and the same may be said of
<i>dephlogisticated marine acid</i>,) if improper, are so not
because they involve theory, but because they involve
false theory;&mdash;not because those who framed them did
not endeavour to express analogies, but because they
expressed analogies about which they were mistaken.
Unconnected names, as <i>metals</i>, <i>earths</i>, <i>alkalis</i>, are good
as the <em>basis</em> of a systematic nomenclature, but they
are not substitutes for such a nomenclature. A systematic
nomenclature is an instrument of great utility
and power, as the modern history of chemistry has
shown. It would be highly unphilosophical to reject <span class="pagenum" id="page298">298</span>
the use of such an instrument, because, in the course
of the revolutions of science, we may have to modify,
or even to remodel it altogether. Its utility is not by
that means destroyed. It has retained, transmitted,
and enabled us to reason upon, the doctrines of the
earlier theory, so far as they are true; and when this
theory is absorbed into a more comprehensive one, (for
this, and not its refutation, is the end of a theory <i>so
far as</i> it is true,) the nomenclature is easily translated
into that which the new theory introduces. We have
seen, in the history of astronomy, how valuable the
theory of <i>epicycles</i> was, in its time: the nomenclature
of the relations of a planet’s orbit, which that theory
introduced, was one of Kepler’s resources in discovering
the <i>elliptical</i> theory; and, though now superseded,
is still readily intelligible to astronomers.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss the reasons for the
<em>form</em> of scientific terms; otherwise we might ask, in
reference to the objections to the Lavoisierian nomenclature,
if such forms as <i>aurum</i> and <i>aura</i> are good to
represent the absence or presence of oxygen, why such
forms as <i>sulphite</i> and <i>sulphate</i> are not equally good to
represent the presence of what we may call a smaller
or larger dose of oxygen, so long as the oxygen theory
is admitted in its present form; and to indicate still
the difference of the same substances, if under any
change of theory it should come to be interpreted in a
new manner.</p>
<p>But I do not now dwell upon such arguments, my
object in this place being to show that terms involving
theory are not only allowable, if understood so far as
the theory is proved, but of great value, and indeed of
indispensable use, in science. The objection to them is
inconsistent with the objects of science. If, after all
that has been done in chemistry or any other science,
we have arrived at no solid knowledge, no permanent
truth;&mdash;if all that we believe now may be proved to
be false to-morrow;&mdash;then indeed our opinions and
theories are corruptible elements, on which it would
be unwise to rest any thing important, and which we
might wish to exclude, even from our names. But if <span class="pagenum" id="page299">299</span>
our knowledge has no more security than this, we can
find no reason why we should wish at all to have names
of things, since the names are needed mainly that we
may reason upon and increase our knowledge such as
it is. If we are condemned to endless alternations of
varying opinions, then, no doubt, our theoretical terms
may be a source of confusion; but then, where would
be the advantage of their being otherwise? what would
be the value of words which should express in a more
precise manner opinions equally fleeting? It will perhaps
be said, our terms must express facts, not theories:
but of this distinction so applied we have repeatedly
shown the futility. Theories firmly established
are facts. Is it not a fact that the rusting of iron
arises from the metal combining with the oxygen of
the atmosphere? Is it not a fact that a combination
of oxygen and hydrogen produces water? That our
terms should express <em>such</em> facts, is precisely what we
are here inculcating.</p>
<p>Our examination of the history of science has led us
to a view very different from that which represents it
as consisting in the succession of hostile opinions. It
is, on the contrary, a progress, in which each step is
recognized and employed in the succeeding one. Every
theory, so far as it is true, (and all that have prevailed
extensively and long, contain a large portion of truth,)
is taken up into the theory which succeeds and seems
to expel it. All the narrower inductions of the first
are included in the more comprehensive generalizations
of the second. And this is performed mainly by means
of such terms as we are now considering;&mdash;terms involving
the previous theory. It is by means of such
terms, that the truths at first ascertained become so
familiar and manageable, that they can be employed as
elementary facts in the formation of higher inductions.</p>
<p>These principles must be applied also, though with
great caution, and in a temperate manner, even to
descriptive language. Thus the mode of describing the
forms of crystals adopted by Werner and Romé de l’Isle
was to consider an original form, from which other
forms are derived by <i>truncations</i> of the edges and the <span class="pagenum" id="page300">300</span>
angles. Haüy’s method of describing the same forms,
was to consider them as built up of rows of small
solids, the angles being determined by the <i>decrements</i>
of these rows. Both these methods of description involve
hypothetical views; and the last was intended to
rest on a true physical theory of the constitution of
crystals. Both hypotheses are doubtful or false: yet
both these methods are good as modes of description:
nor is Haüy’s terminology vitiated, if we suppose (as
in fact we must suppose in many instances,) that crystalline
bodies are not really made up of such small
solids. The mode of describing an octahedron of fluor
spar, as derived from the cube, by decrements of one
row on all the edges, would still be proper and useful
as a description, whatever judgment we should form of
the material structure of the body. But then, we must
consider the solids which are thus introduced into the
description as merely hypothetical geometrical forms,
serving to determine the angles of the faces. It is in
this way alone that Haüy’s nomenclature can now be
retained.</p>
<p>In like manner we may admit theoretical views into
the descriptive phraseology of other parts of Natural
History: and the theoretical terms will replace the
obvious images, in proportion as the theory is generally
accepted and familiarly applied. For example, in
speaking of the Honeysuckle, we may say that the
upper leaves are <i>perfoliate</i>, meaning that a single
round leaf is perforated by the stalk, or threaded upon
it. Here is an image which sufficiently conveys the
notion of the form. But it is now generally recognized
that this apparent single leaf is, in fact, two opposite
leaves joined together at their bases. If this were doubted,
it may be proved by comparing the upper leaves
with the lower, which are really separate and opposite.
Hence the term <i>connate</i> is applied to these conjoined
opposite leaves, implying that they grow together; or
they are called <i>connato-perfoliate</i>. Again; formerly
the corolla was called <i>monopetalous</i> or <i>polypetalous</i>, as
it consisted of one part or of several: but it is now
agreed among botanists that those corollas which <span class="pagenum" id="page301">301</span> appear
to consist of a single part, are, in fact, composed
of several soldered together; hence the term <i>gamopetalous</i>
is now employed (by De Candolle and his followers) instead
of monopetalous<a id="fnanchor36-4" href="#note36-4"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>.</p>

<p class="end">In this way the language of Natural History not
only expresses, but inevitably implies, general laws of
nature; and words are thus fitted to aid the progress
of knowledge in this, as in other provinces of science.</p>
<p class="center" id="a12"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XII.</p>
<p><i>If terms are systematically good, they are not to be rejected
because they are etymologically inaccurate.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">Terms</span> belonging to a system are defined, not by the
meaning of their radical words, but by their place in
the system. That they should be appropriate in their
signification, aids the processes of introducing and
remembering them, and should therefore be carefully
attended to by those who invent and establish them;
but this once done, no objections founded upon their
etymological import are of any material weight. We
find no inconvenience in the circumstance that <i>geometry</i>
means the measuring of the earth, that the name
<i>porphyry</i> is applied to many rocks which have no fiery
spots, as the word implies, and <i>oolite</i> to strata which
have no roelike structure. In like manner, if the term
<i>pœcilite</i> were already generally received, as the name
of a certain group of strata, it would be no valid
ground for quarrelling with it, that this group was not
always variegated in colour, or that other groups were
equally variegated: although undoubtedly in <em>introducing</em>
such a term, care should be taken to make it
as distinctive as possible. It often happens, as we have
seen, that by the natural progress of changes in language,
a word is steadily confirmed in a sense quite
different from its etymological import. But though <span class="pagenum" id="page302">302</span>
we may accept such instances, we must not wantonly
attempt to imitate them. I say, not wantonly: for if
the progress of scientific identification compel us to
follow any class of objects into circumstances where
the derivation of the term is inapplicable, we may still
consider the term as an unmeaning sound, or rather
an historical symbol, expressing a certain member of
our system. Thus if, in following the course of the
<i>mountain</i> or <i>carboniferous</i> limestone, we find that in
Ireland it does not form mountains nor contain coal,
we should act unwisely in breaking down the nomenclature
in which our systematic relations are already
expressed, in order to gain, in a particular case,
a propriety of language which has no scientific value.</p>
<p>All attempts to act upon the maxim opposite to
this, and to make our scientific names properly descriptive
of the objects, have failed and must fail. For
the marks which really distinguish the natural classes
of objects, are by no means obvious. The discovery of
them is one of the most important steps in science;
and when they are discovered, they are constantly
liable to exceptions, because they do not contain the
essential differences of the classes. The natural order
<i>Umbellatæ</i>, in order to be a natural order,
must contain some plants which have not umbels, as
<i>Eryngium</i><a id="fnanchor37-4" href="#note37-4"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>.
‘In such cases,’ said Linnæus, ‘it is of small import
what you call the order, if you take a proper series
of plants, and give it some name which is clearly understood
to apply to the plants you have associated.’
‘I have,’ he adds, ‘followed the rule of borrowing the
name <i>à fortiori</i>, from the principal feature.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-4" href="#fnanchor37-4">37</a></span>
See <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvi. c. iv. sect. 5.
</div>
<p>The distinction of crystals into systems according to
the degree of symmetry which obtains in them, has
been explained elsewhere. Two of these systems, of
which the relation as to symmetry might be expressed
by saying that one is <i>square pyramidal</i> and the other
<i>oblong pyramidal</i>, or the first <i>square prismatic</i> and the
second <i>oblong prismatic</i>, are termed by Mohs, the first,
<i>Pyramidal</i>, and the second <i>Prismatic</i>. And it may <span class="pagenum" id="page303">303</span>
be doubted whether it is worth while to invent other
terms, though these are thus defective in characteristic
significance. As an example of a needless rejection of
old terms in virtue of a supposed impropriety in their
meaning, I may mention the attempt made in the last
edition of Haüy’s <i>Mineralogy</i>, to substitute <i>autopside</i>
and <i>heteropside</i> for <i>metallic</i> and <i>unmetallic</i>. It was
supposed to be proved that all bodies have a metal for
their basis; and hence it was wished to avoid the term
<i>unmetallic</i>. But the words <i>metallic</i> and <i>unmetallic</i>
may mean that minerals <em>seem</em> metallic and unmetallic,
just as well as if they contained the element <i>opside</i> to
imply this seeming. The old names express all that
the new express, and with more simplicity, and therefore
should not be disturbed.</p>
<p>The maxim on which we are now insisting, that we
are not to be too scrupulous about the etymology of
scientific terms, may, at first sight, appear to be at
variance with our <a href="#a4">Fourth</a> Aphorism, that words used
technically are to retain their common meaning as far
as possible. But it must be recollected, that in the
Fourth Aphorism we spoke of <i>common</i> words <i>appropriated</i>
as technical terms; we here speak of words
<i>constructed</i> for scientific purposes. And although it is,
perhaps, impossible to draw a broad line between these
two classes of terms, still the rule of propriety may be
stated thus: In technical terms, deviations from the
usual meaning of words are bad in proportion as the
words are more familiar in our own language. Thus
we may apply the term <i>Cirrus</i> to a cloud composed of
filaments, even if these filaments are straight; but to
call such a cloud a <i>Curl cloud</i> would be much more
harsh.</p>
<p class="end">Since the names of things, and of classes of things,
when constructed so as to involve a description, are
constantly liable to become bad, the natural classes
shifting away from the descriptive marks thus prematurely
and casually adopted, I venture to lay down
the following maxim. <span class="pagenum" id="page304">304</span></p>
<p class="center" id="a13"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XIII.</p>
<p><i>The fundamental terms of a system of Nomenclature may
be conveniently borrowed from casual or arbitrary circumstances.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">For</span> instance, the names of plants, of minerals, and
of geological strata, may be taken from the places
where they occur conspicuously or in a distinct form;
as <i>Parietaria</i>, <i>Parnassia</i>, <i>Chalcedony</i>,
<i>Arragonite</i>, <i>Silurian</i> system, <i>Purbeck</i> limestone. These names may
be considered as at first supplying standards of reference;
for in order to ascertain whether any rock be
<i>Purbeck</i> limestone, we might compare it with the
rocks in the Isle of Purbeck. But this reference to a
local standard is of authority only till the place of the
object in the system, and its distinctive marks, are ascertained.
It would not vitiate the above names, if it
were found that the <i>Parnassia</i> does not grow on Parnassus;
that <i>Chalcedony</i> is not found in Chalcedon; or
even that <i>Arragonite</i> no longer occurs in Arragon; for
it is now firmly established as a mineral species. Even
in geology such a reference is arbitrary, and may be
superseded, or at least modified, by a more systematic
determination. <i>Alpine</i> limestone is no longer accepted
as a satisfactory designation of a rock, now that we
know the limestone of the Alps to be of various ages.</p>
<p>Again, names of persons, either casually connected
with the object, or arbitrarily applied to it, may be
employed as designations. This has been done most
copiously in botany, as for example, <i>Nicotiana</i>, <i>Dahlia</i>,
<i>Fuchsia</i>, <i>Jungermannia</i>, <i>Lonicera</i>. And Linnæus has
laid down rules for restricting this mode of perpetuating
the memory of men, in the names of plants.
Those generic names, he
says<a id="fnanchor38-4" href="#note38-4"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>,
which have been constructed
to preserve the memory of persons who have
deserved well of botany, are to be religiously retained.
This, he adds, is the sole and supreme reward of the
botanist’s labours, and must be carefully guarded and <span class="pagenum" id="page305">305</span>
scrupulously bestowed, as an encouragement and an
honour. Still more arbitrary are the terms borrowed
from the names of the gods and goddesses, heroes and
heroines of antiquity, to designate new genera in those
departments of natural history in which so many have
been discovered in recent times as to weary out all
attempts at descriptive nomenclature. Cuvier has
countenanced this method. ‘I have had to frame many
new names of genera and sub-genera,’ he
says<a id="fnanchor39-4" href="#note39-4"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a>, ‘for
the sub-genera which I have established were so
numerous and various, that the memory is not satisfied
with numerical indications. These I have chosen
either so as to indicate some character, or among the
usual denominations, which I have latinized, or finally,
after the example of Linnæus, among the names of
mythology, which are in general agreeable to the ear,
and which are far from being exhausted.’</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-4" href="#fnanchor39-4">39</a></span>
<i>Règne An.</i> p. 16.
</div>
<p>This mode of framing names from the names of persons
to whom it was intended to do honour, has been
employed also in the mathematical and chemical sciences;
but such names have rarely obtained any permanence,
except when they recorded an inventor or
discoverer. Some of the constellations, indeed, have
retained such appellations, as <i>Berenice’s Hair</i>; and the
new star which shone out in the time of Cæsar, would
probably have retained the name given to it, of the
<i>Julian Star</i>, if it had not disappeared again soon after.
In the map of the Moon, almost all the parts have
had such names imposed upon them by those who
have constructed such maps, and these names have
very properly been retained. But the names of new
planets and satellites thus suggested have not been
generally accepted; as the <i>Medicean</i> stars, the name
employed by Galileo for the satellites of Jupiter; the
<i>Georgium Sidus</i>, the appellation proposed by Herschel
for Uranus when first
discovered<a id="fnanchor40-4" href="#note40-4"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a>;
Ceres <i>Ferdinandea</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page306">306</span>
the name which Piazzi wished to impose on the small
planet Ceres. The names given to astronomical Tables
by the astronomers who constructed them have been
most steadily adhered to, being indeed names of books,
and not of natural objects. Thus there were the
<i>Ilchanic</i>, the <i>Alphonsine</i>, the <i>Rudolphine</i>,
the <i>Carolinian</i> Tables. Comets which have been ascertained
to be periodical, have very properly had assigned to
them the name of the person who established this
point; and of these we have thus, <i>Halley’s</i>, <i>Encke’s
Comet</i>, and <i>Biela’s</i> or <i>Gambart’s Comet</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-4" href="#fnanchor40-4">40</a></span>
In this case, the name <i>Uranus</i>, selected with
a view to symmetry according to the mythological order of descent
of the persons (<i>Uranus</i>, <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Mars</i>)
was adopted by astronomers in general, though not proposed or
sanctioned by the discoverer of the new planet. In the cases of
the smaller planets, <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Pallas</i>, <i>Juno</i>, and <i>Vesta</i>,
the names were given either by the discoverer, or with his sanction.
Following this rule, Bessel gave the name of <i>Astræa</i> to a new
planet discovered in the same region by Mr. Hencke, as mentioned in
the additions to book vii. of the <i>History</i> (2nd Ed.). Following the
same rule, and adhering as much as possible to mythological connexion,
the astronomers of Europe have with the sanction of M. Le Verrier,
given the name of <i>Neptune</i> to the planet revolving beyond Uranus,
and discovered in consequence of his announcement of its probable existence,
which had been inferred by Mr. Adams and him (calculating in ignorance
of each other’s purpose) from the perturbations of Uranus; as I
have stated in the Additions to the Third Edition of the <i>History</i>.
</div>
<p>In the case of discoveries in science or inventions of
apparatus, the name of the inventor is very properly
employed as the designation. Thus we have the <i>Torricellian</i>
Vacuum, the <i>Voltaic</i> Pile, <i>Fahrenheit’s</i> Thermometer.
And in the same manner with regard to
laws of nature, we have <i>Kepler’s</i> Laws, <i>Boyle</i> or <i>Mariotte’s</i>
law of the elasticity of air, <i>Huyghens’s</i> law of
double refraction, <i>Newton’s</i> scale of colours. <i>Descartes’</i>
law of refraction is an unjust appellation; for the discovery
of the law of sines was made by Snell. In deductive mathematics,
where the invention of a theorem
is generally a more definite step than an induction,
this mode of designation is more common, as <i>Demoivre’s</i>
Theorem, <i>Maclaurin’s</i> Theorem, <i>Lagrange’s</i> Theorem,
<i>Eulerian</i> Integrals.</p>
<p>In the <i>History of Science</i><a id="fnanchor41-4" href="#note41-4"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> I have remarked that in
the discovery of what is termed galvanism, Volta’s <span class="pagenum" id="page307">307</span>
office was of a higher and more philosophical kind
than that of Galvani; and I have, on this account,
urged the propriety of employing the term <i>voltaic</i>,
rather than <i>galvanic</i> electricity. I may add that the
electricity of the common machine is often placed in
contrast with this, and appears to require an express
name. Mr. Faraday calls it <i>common</i> or <i>machine</i> electricity;
but I think that <i>franklinic</i> electricity would
form a more natural correspondence with <i>voltaic</i>, and
would be well justified by Franklin’s place in the history
of that part of the subject.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XIV.</p>
<p><i>The Binary Method of Nomenclature</i> (<i>Names by Genus
and Species</i>) <i>is the most convenient hitherto employed in
Classification.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> number of species in every province of Natural
History is so vast that we cannot distinguish them
and record the distinctions without some artifice. The
known species of plants, for instance, were 10,000 in the
time of Linnæus, and are now probably 60,000. It
would be useless to endeavour to frame and employ
separate names for each of these species.</p>
<p>The division of the objects into a subordinated system
of classification enables us to introduce a Nomenclature
which does not require this enormous number
of names. The artifice employed is, to name a specimen
by means of two (or it might be more) steps of the
successive division. Thus in Botany, each of the Genera
has its name, and the species are marked by the addition
of some epithet to the name of the genus. In this
manner about 1,700 Generic Names, with a moderate
number of Specific Names, were found by Linnæus
sufficient to designate with precision all the species of
vegetables known at his time. And this <i>Binary Method</i> of
Nomenclature has been found so convenient,
that it has been universally adopted in every other
department of the Natural History of organized beings. <span class="pagenum" id="page308">308</span></p>
<p class="end">Many other modes of Nomenclature have been tried,
but no other has at all taken root. Linnæus himself
appears at first to have intended marking each species
by the Generic Name, accompanied by a characteristic
Descriptive Phrase; and to have proposed the employment
of a <i>Trivial</i> Specific Name, as he termed it, only
as a method of occasional convenience. The use of
these trivial names, however, has become universal, as
we have said; and is by many persons considered the
greatest improvement introduced at the Linnæan reform.</p>
<p class="center" id="a15"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XV.</p>
<p><i>The Maxims of Linnæus concerning the Names to be used
in Botany</i>, (Philosophia Botanica, Nomina. Sections 210
to 255) <i>are good examples of Aphorisms on this subject.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">Both</span> Linnæus and other writers (as Adanson) have
given many maxims with a view of regulating the
selection of generic and specific names. The maxims
of Linnæus were intended as much as possible to exclude
barbarism and confusion, and have, upon the
whole, been generally adopted.</p>
<p>These canons, and the sagacious modesty of great
botanists, like Robert Brown, in conforming to them,
have kept the majority of good botanists within salutary
limits; though many of these canons were objected to by
the contemporaries of Linnæus (Adanson
and others<a id="fnanchor42-4" href="#note42-4"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a>)
as capricious and unnecessary restrictions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-4" href="#fnanchor42-4">42</a></span>
Pref. cxxix. clxxii.
</div>
<p>Many of the names introduced by Linnæus certainly
appear fanciful enough. Thus he gives the name <i>Bauhinia</i>
to a plant which has leaves in pairs, because the
Bauhins were a pair of brothers. <i>Banisteria</i> is the
name of a climbing plant in honour of Banister, who
travelled among mountains. But such names once
established by adequate authority lose all their
inconvenience and easily become permanent, and hence the
reasonableness of one of the Linnæan
rules<a id="fnanchor43-4" href="#note43-4"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a>:&mdash;<br />
&emsp;That as such a perpetuation of the names of persons <span class="pagenum" id="page309">309</span>
by the names of plants is the only honour that botanists
have to bestow, it ought to be used with care and
caution, and religiously respected.</p>

<i>Phil. Bot.</i> s. 239.
</div>
<p>[3rd ed. It may serve to show how sensitive botanists
are to the allusions contained in such names,
that it has been charged against Linnæus, as a proof
of malignity towards Buffon, that he changed the name
of the genus <i>Buffonia</i>, established by Sauvages, into
<i>Bufonia</i>, which suggested a derivation from <i>Bufo</i>, a
toad. It appears to be proved that the spelling was not
Linnæus’s doing.]</p>
<p>Another Linnæan maxim is (Art. 219), that the generic
name must be fixed before we attempt to form a
specific name; ‘the latter without the former is like
the clapper without the bell.’</p>
<p>The name of the genus being fixed, the species may
be marked (Art. 257) by adding to it ‘a single word
taken at will from any quarter;’ that is, it need not
involve a description or any essential property of the
plant, but may be a casual or arbitrary appellation.
Thus the various species of
<i>Hieracium</i><a id="fnanchor44-4" href="#note44-4"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>
are <i>Hieracium
Alpinum</i>, <i>H. Halleri</i>, <i>H. Pilosella</i>, <i>H. dubium</i>, <i>H.
murorum</i>, &amp;c., where we see how different may be the
kind of origin of the words.</p>

</div>
<p class="end">Attempts have been made at various times to form
the names of species from those of genera in some more
symmetrical manner. But these have not been successful,
nor are they likely to be so; and we shall venture
to propound an axiom in condemnation of such names.</p>
<p class="center" id="a16"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XVI.</p>
<p><i>Numerical names in Classification are bad; and the same
may be said of other names of kinds, depending upon any
fixed series of notes of order.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">With</span> regard to numerical names of kinds, of species
for instance, the objections are of this nature. Besides
that such names offer nothing for the imagination to
take hold of, new discoveries will probably alter the <span class="pagenum" id="page310">310</span>
numeration, and make the names erroneous. Thus, if
we call the species of a genus 1, 2, 3, a new species
intermediate between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, &amp;c. cannot be
put in its place without damaging the numbers.</p>
<p>The geological term <i>Trias</i>, lately introduced to designate
the group consisting of the <em>three</em> members
(Bunter Sandstein, Muschelkalk, and Keuper) becomes
improper if, as some geologists hold, two of these
members cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Objections resembling those which apply to numerical
designations of species, apply to other cases of fixed
series: for instance, when it has been proposed to mark
the species by altering the termination of the genus.
Thus Adanson<a id="fnanchor45-4" href="#note45-4"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>,
denoting a genus by the name <i>Fonna</i>
(<i>Lychnidea</i>), conceived he might mark five of its species
by altering the last syllable, <i>Fonna</i>, <i>Fonna-e</i>, <i>Fonna-i</i>,
<i>Fonna-o</i>, <i>Fonna-u</i>; then others by <i>Fonna-ba</i>, <i>Fonna-ka</i>,
and so on. This would be liable to the same evils

In like manner the names assigned by Mr. Rickman
to the successive of styles of Gothic architecture in England,&mdash;<i>Early
English</i>, <i>Decorated</i>, and <i>Perpendicular</i>,&mdash;cannot
be replaced by numerical designations, <i>First Pointed</i>,
<i>Second Pointed</i>, <i>Third Pointed</i>. For&mdash;besides that
he who first distinctly establishes classes has the right of
naming them, and that Mr. Rickman’s names are really appropriate
and significant&mdash;these new names would confound all meaning
of language. We should not be able to divide Early English, or Decorated,
or Perpendicular into sub-styles;&mdash;for who could talk of <i>First
Second Pointed</i> and <i>Second Second Pointed</i>; and what
should we call that pointed style&mdash;the <i>Transition</i>
from the Norman&mdash;which precedes the <i>First Pointed</i>?
</div>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XVII.</p>
<p><i>In any classificatory science names including more than
two steps of the classification may be employed if it be found
convenient.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">Linnæus</span>, in his canons for botanical nomenclature
(Art. 212), says that the names of the class and the
order are to be <em>mute</em>, while the names of the Genus
and Species are <em>sonorous</em>. And accordingly the names <span class="pagenum" id="page311">311</span>
of plants (and the same is true of animals) have in common
practice been binary only, consisting of a generic
and a specific name. The class and the order have not
been admitted to form part of the appellation of the
species. Indeed it is easy to see that a name, which
must be identical in so many instances as that of an
Order would be, would be felt as superfluous and burthensome.
Accordingly, Linnæus makes it one of his
maxims<a id="fnanchor47-4" href="#note47-4"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a>,
that the name of the Class and Order must not
be expressed but understood, and hence, he says, Royen,
who took <i>Lilium</i> for the name of a Class, rightly
rejected this word as a generic name, and substituted
<i>Lirium</i> with the Greek termination.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-4" href="#fnanchor47-4">47</a></span>
<i>Phil. Bot.</i> s. 215.
</div>
<p>Yet we must not too peremptorily assume such
maxims as these to be universal for all classificatory
sciences. It is very possible that it may be found advisable
to use <em>three</em> terms, that of Order, Genus, and
Species in designating minerals, as is done in Mohs’s
nomenclature, for example, <i>Rhombohedral Calc Haloide</i>,
<i>Paratomous Hal Baryte</i>.</p>
<p class="end">It is possible also that it may be found useful in the
same science (Mineralogy) to mark some of the steps of
classification by the termination. Thus it has been proposed
to confine the termination <i>ite</i> to the Order <i>Silicides</i>
of Naumann, as Apophyll<i>ite</i>, Stilb<i>ite</i>, Leuc<i>ite</i>, &amp;c.,
and to use names of different form in other orders, as
Talc <i>Spar</i> for Brennerite, Pyramidal Titanium <i>Oxide</i>
for Octahedrite. Some such method appears to be the
most likely to give us a tolerable mineralogical nomenclature.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XVIII.</p>
<p><i>In forming a Terminology, words may be invented when
necessary, but they cannot be conveniently borrowed from
casual or arbitrary
circumstances</i><a id="fnanchor48-4" href="#note48-4"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-4" href="#fnanchor48-4">48</a></span>
I may also refer to <i>Hist. Sc. Id.</i> b. viii.
c. ii. sec. 2, for some remarks on Terminology.
</div>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> will be recollected that Terminology is a language
employed for describing objects, Nomenclature, a body <span class="pagenum" id="page312">312</span>
of names of the objects themselves. The <i>names</i>, as
was stated in the last maxim, may be arbitrary; but
the <i>descriptive</i> terms must be borrowed from words of
suitable meaning in the modern or the classical languages.
Thus the whole terminology which Linnæus
introduced into botany, is founded upon the received
use of Latin words, although he defined their meaning
so as to make it precise when it was not so, according
to Aphorism <a href="#a5">V.</a> But many of the terms were invented by him
and other botanists, as <i>Perianth</i>, <i>Nectary</i>,
<i>Pericarp</i>; so many, indeed, as to form, along with the
others, a considerable language. Many of the terms
which are now become familiar were originally invented
by writers on botany. Thus the word <i>Petal</i>,
for one division of the corolla, was introduced by
Fabius Columna. The term <i>Sepal</i> was devised by
Necker to express each of the divisions of the calyx.
And up to the most recent times, new denominations
of parts and conditions of parts have been devised by
botanists, when they found them necessary, in order to
mark important differences or resemblances. Thus the
general <i>Receptacle</i> of the flower, as it is termed by
Linnæus, or <i>Torus</i> by Salisbury, is continued into
organs which carry the stamina and pistil, or the pistil
alone, or the whole flower; this organ has hence been
termed<a id="fnanchor49-4" href="#note49-4"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a>
<i>Gonophore</i>, <i>Carpophore</i>, and <i>Anthophore</i>, in
these cases.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-4" href="#fnanchor49-4">49</a></span>
De Candolle’s <i>Th. El.</i> 405.
</div>
<p>In like manner when Cuvier had ascertained that
the lower jaws of Saurians consisted always of six
pieces having definite relations of form and position,
he gave names to them, and termed them respectively
the <i>Dental</i>, the <i>Angular</i>, the <i>Coronoid</i>, the <i>Articular</i>,
the <i>Complementary</i>, and the <i>Opercular</i> Bones.</p>
<p>In all these cases, the descriptive terms thus introduced
have been significant in their derivation. An
attempt to circulate a perfectly arbitrary word as a
means of description would probably be unsuccessful.
We have, indeed, some examples approaching to arbitrary
designations, in the Wernerian names of colours, <span class="pagenum" id="page313">313</span>
which are a part of the terminology of Natural History.
Many of these names are borrowed from natural
resemblances, as <i>Auricula purple</i>, <i>Apple green</i>, <i>Straw
yellow</i>; but the names of others are taken from casual
occurrences, mostly, however, such as were already
recognized in common language, as <i>Prussian blue</i>,
<i>Dutch orange</i>, <i>King’s yellow</i>.</p>
<p class="end">The extension of arbitrary names in scientific terminology
is by no means to be encouraged. I may mention a case
in which it was very properly avoided.
When Mr. Faraday’s researches on Voltaic electricity
had led him to perceive the great impropriety of the
term <i>poles</i>, as applied to the apparatus, since
the processes have not reference to any opposed points, but to
two opposite directions of a path, he very suitably
wished to substitute for the phrases <i>positive pole</i> and
<i>negative pole</i>, two words ending in <i>ode</i>, from <span class="greek">ὅδος</span>, a
way. A person who did not see the value of our present maxim,
that descriptive terms should be descriptive in their origin,
might have proposed words perfectly arbitrary, as <i>Alphode</i>,
and <i>Betode</i>: or, if he
wished to pay a tribute of respect to the discoverers
in this department of science, <i>Galvanode</i> and <i>Voltaode</i>,
But such words would very justly have been rejected
by Mr. Faraday, and would hardly have obtained any
general currency among men of science. <i>Zincode</i> and
<i>Platinode</i>, terms derived from the metal which, in one
modification of the apparatus, forms what was previously
termed the pole, are to be avoided, because in
their origin too much is casual; and they are not a
good basis for derivative terms. The pole at which
the zinc is, is the Anode or Cathode, according as it is
associated with different metals. Either the <i>Zincode</i>
must sometimes mean the pole at which the Zinc is,
and at other times that at which the Zinc is not, or
else we must have as many names for poles as there
are metals. <i>Anode</i> and <i>Cathode</i>, the terms which Mr.
Faraday adopted, were free from these objections; for
they refer to a natural standard of the direction of the
voltaic current, in a manner which, though perhaps
not obvious at first sight, is easily understood and <span class="pagenum" id="page314">314</span>
retained. <i>An</i>ode and <i>Cath</i>ode, the <i>rising</i> and the <i>setting</i>
way, are the directions which correspond to east and
west in that voltaic current to which we must ascribe
terrestrial magnetism. And with these words it was
easy to connect <i>Anïon</i> and <i>Cathïon</i>, to designate the
opposite elements which are separated and liberated at
the two <i>Electrodes</i>.</p>
<p class="center" id="a19"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XIX.</p>
<p><i>The meaning of Technical Terms must be fixed by convention,
not by casual reference to the ordinary meaning of
words.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> fixing the meaning of the Technical Terms which
form the Terminology of any science, at least of the
descriptive Terms, we necessarily fix, at the same time,
the perceptions and notions which the Terms are to
convey to a hearer. What do we mean by <i>apple-green</i> or
<i>French grey</i>? It might, perhaps, be supposed that, in
the first example, the term <i>apple</i>, referring to so familiar
an object, sufficiently suggests the colour intended.
But it may easily be seen that this is not true; for
apples are of many different hues of green, and it is
only by a conventional selection that we can appropriate
the term to one special shade. When this appropriation
is once made, the term refers to the sensation,
and not to the parts of this term; for these enter into
the compound merely as a help to the memory, whether
the suggestion be a natural connexion as in ‘apple-green,’
or a casual one as in ‘French grey.’ In order
to derive due advantage from technical terms of this
kind, they must be associated <em>immediately</em> with
the perception to which they belong; and not connected with
it through the vague usages of common language. The
memory must retain the sensation; and the technical
word must be understood as directly as the most familiar word,
and more distinctly. When we find such
terms as <i>tin-white</i> or <i>pinchbeck-brown</i>, the metallic
colour so denoted ought to start up in our memory
without delay or search. <span class="pagenum" id="page315">315</span></p>
<p>This, which it is most important to recollect with
respect to the simpler properties of bodies, as colour
and form, is no less true with respect to more compound
notions. In all cases the term is fixed to a peculiar
meaning by convention; and the student, in order to
use the word, must be completely familiar with the convention,
so that he has no need to frame conjectures
from the word itself. Such conjectures would always
be insecure, and often erroneous. Thus the term <i>papilionaceous</i>,
applied to a flower, is employed to indicate,
not only a resemblance to a butterfly, but a resemblance
arising from five petals of a certain peculiar shape and
arrangement; and even if the resemblance to a butterfly
were much stronger than it is in such cases, yet if it
were produced in a different way, as, for example, by
one petal, or two only, instead of a ‘standard,’ two
‘wings,’ and a ‘keel’ consisting of two parts more or
less united into one, we should no longer be justified in
speaking of it as a ‘papilionaceous’ flower.</p>
<p>The formation of an exact and extensive descriptive
language for botany has been executed with a degree of
skill and felicity, which, before it was attained, could
hardly have been dreamt of as attainable. Every part
of a plant has been named; and the form of every part,
even the most minute, has had a large assemblage of
descriptive terms appropriated to it, by means of which
the botanist can convey and receive knowledge of form
and structure, as exactly as if each minute part were
presented to him vastly magnified. This acquisition
was part of the Linnæan Reform, of which we have
spoken in the <i>History</i>. ‘Tournefort,’ says De Candolle<a id="fnanchor50-4" href="#note50-4"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a>,
‘appears to have been the first who really perceived the
utility of fixing the sense of terms in such a way as
always to employ the same word in the same sense, and
always to express the same idea by the same word; but
it was Linnæus who really created and fixed this botanical
language, and this is his fairest claim to glory, for
by this fixation of language he has shed clearness and
precision over all parts of the science.’</p>

<i>Théor. Élém.</i> p. 327. <span class="pagenum" id="page316" style="font-size: large">316</span>
</div>
<p>It is
not necessary here to give any detailed account
of the terms of botany. The fundamental ones have
been gradually introduced, as the parts of plants were
more carefully and minutely examined. Thus the
flower was successively distinguished into the <i>calyx</i>, the
<i>corolla</i>, the <i>stamens</i>, and the <i>pistils</i>: the sections of
the corolla were termed <i>petals</i> by Columna; those of
the calyx were called <i>sepals</i> by
Necker<a id="fnanchor51-4" href="#note51-4"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a>. Sometimes
terms of greater generality were devised; as <i>perianth</i>
to include the calyx and corolla, whether one or both of
these were present<a id="fnanchor52-4" href="#note52-4"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a>;
<i>pericarp</i> for the part inclosing the
grain, of whatever kind it be, fruit, nut, pod, &amp;c. And
it may easily be imagined that descriptive terms may,
by definition and combination, become very numerous
and distinct. Thus leaves may be called
<i>pinnatifid</i><a id="fnanchor53-4" href="#note53-4"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a>,
<i>pinnnatipartite</i>,
<i>pinnatisect</i>, <i>pinnatilobate</i>, <i>palmatifid</i>, <i>palmatipartite</i>,
&amp;c., and each of these words designates
different combinations of the modes and extent of the
divisions of the leaf with the divisions of its outline. In
some cases arbitrary numerical relations are introduced
into the definition: thus a leaf is called
<i>bilobate</i><a id="fnanchor54-4" href="#note54-4"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a>
when
it is divided into two parts by a notch; but if the notch
go to the middle of its length, it is <i>bifid</i>; if it go near
the base of the leaf, it is <i>bipartite</i>; if to the base, it is
<i>bisect</i>. Thus, too, a pod of a cruciferous plant is
a <i>silica</i><a id="fnanchor55-4" href="#note55-4"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a>
if it be four times as long as it is broad, but if it be
shorter than this it is a <i>silicula</i>. Such terms being
established, the form of the very complex leaf or frond
of a fern is exactly conveyed, for example, by the following phrase:
‘fronds rigid pinnate, pinnæ recurved
subunilateral pinnatifid, the segments linear undivided
or bifid spinuloso-serrate<a id="fnanchor56-4" href="#note56-4"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a>.’</p>

<p>Other characters, as well as form, are conveyed with
the like precision: Colour by means of a classified scale
of colours, as we have seen in speaking of the
<a href="#b3c2a22">Measures</a> <span class="pagenum" id="page317">317</span>
of Secondary Qualities; to which, however, we must
add, that the naturalist employs arbitrary names, (such
as we have already quoted,) and not mere numerical
exponents, to indicate a certain number of selected
colours. This was done with most precision by Werner,
and his scale of colours is still the most usual standard
of naturalists. Werner also introduced a more exact
terminology with regard to other characters which are
important in mineralogy, as lustre, hardness. But
Mohs improved upon this step by giving a numerical
scale of hardness, in which <i>talc</i> is 1, <i>gypsum</i>, 2, <i>calc spar</i>
3, and so on, as we have already explained in the History
of Mineralogy. Some properties, as specific gravity,
by their definition give at once a numerical
measure; and others, as crystalline form, require a
very considerable array of mathematical calculation
and reasoning, to point out their relations and gradations.
In all cases the features of likeness in the objects
must be rightly apprehended, in order to their
being expressed by a distinct terminology. Thus no
terms could describe crystals for any purpose of natural
history, till it was discovered that in a class of minerals
the proportion of the faces might vary, while the angle
remained the same. Nor could crystals be described so
as to distinguish species, till it was found that the
derived and primitive forms are connected by very simple
relations of space and number. The discovery of the
mode in which characters must be apprehended so that
they may be considered as <em>fixed</em> for a class,
is an important step in the progress of each branch of Natural
History; and hence we have had, in the History of
Mineralogy and Botany, to distinguish as important
and eminent persons those who made such discoveries,
Romé de Lisle and Haüy, Cæsalpinus and Gesner.</p>
<p>By the continued progress of that knowledge of minerals,
plants, and other natural objects, in which such
persons made the most distinct and marked steps, but
which has been constantly advancing in a more gradual
and imperceptible manner, the most important and essential
features of similarity and dissimilarity in such
objects have been selected, arranged, and fitted with <span class="pagenum" id="page318">318</span>
names; and we have thus in such departments, systems
of Terminology which fix our attention upon the
resemblances which it is proper to consider, and enable us to
convey them in words.</p>
<p>The following Aphorisms respect the Form of Technical Terms.</p>
<p class="end">By the <i>Form</i> of terms, I mean their philological
conditions; as, for example, from what languages they
may be borrowed, by what modes of inflexion they
must be compounded, how their derivatives are to be
formed, and the like. In this, as in other parts of the
subject, I shall not lay down a system of rules, but
shall propose a few maxims.</p>
<p class="center" id="a20"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XX.</p>
<p><i>The two main conditions of the Form of technical terms
are, that they must be generally intelligible, and susceptible
of such grammatical relations as their scientific use requires.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">These</span> conditions may at first appear somewhat
vague, but it will be found that they are as definite as
we could make them, without injuriously restricting
ourselves. It will appear, moreover, that they have
an important bearing upon most of the questions respecting
the form of the words which come before us;
and that if we can succeed in any case in reconciling
the two conditions, we obtain terms which are practically good,
whatever objections may be urged against
them from other considerations.</p>
<p id="b4a20a1">1. The former condition, for instance, bears upon
the question whether scientific terms are to be taken
from the learned languages, Greek and Latin, or from
our own. And the latter condition very materially
affects the same question, since in English we have
scarcely any power of inflecting our words; and therefore
must have recourse to Greek or Latin in order to
obtain terms which admit of grammatical modification.
If we were content with the term <i>Heat</i>, to express the
<em>science</em> of heat, still it would be a bad technical term,
for we cannot derive from it an adjective like <span class="pagenum" id="page319">319</span>
<i>thermotical</i>.
If <i>bed</i> or <i>layer</i> were an equally good term with
<i>stratum</i>, we must still retain the latter, in order that
we may use the derivative <i>Stratification</i>, for which the
English words cannot produce an equivalent substitute.
We may retain the words <i>lime</i> and <i>flint</i>, but
their adjectives for scientific purposes are not <i>limy</i>
and <i>flinty</i>, but <i>calcareous</i> and <i>siliceous</i>; and hence we
are able to form a compound, as <i>calcareo-siliceous</i>,
which we could not do with indigenous words. We
might fix the phrases <i>bent back</i> and <i>broken</i> to mean (of
optical rays) that they are reflected and refracted; but
then we should have no means of speaking of the
angles of <i>Reflection</i> and <i>Refraction</i>, of the <i>Refractive</i>
Indices, and the like.</p>
<p>In like manner, so long as anatomists described certain
parts of a vertebra as <i>vertebral laminæ</i>, or <i>vertebral
plates</i>, they had no adjective whereby to signify
the properties of these parts; the term <i>Neurapophysis</i>,
given to them by Mr. Owen, supplies the corresponding
expression <i>neurapophysial</i>. So again, the term
<i>Basisphenoid</i>, employed by the same anatomist, is
better than <i>basilar</i> or <i>basial process of the sphenoid</i>,
because it gives us the adjective <i>basisphenoidal</i>. And
the like remark applies to other changes recently
proposed in the names of portions of the skeleton.</p>
<p>Thus one of the advantages of going to the Greek
and Latin languages for the origin of our scientific
terms is, that in this way we obtain words which
admit of the formation of adjectives and abstract
terms, and of composition, and of other inflexions.
Another advantage of such an origin is, that such terms,
if well selected, are readily understood over the whole
lettered world. For this reason, the descriptive language
of science, of botany for instance, has been, for
the most part, taken from the Latin; many of the
terms of the mathematical and chemical sciences have
been derived from the Greek; and when occasion
occurs to construct a new term, it is generally to that
language that recourse is had. The advantage of such
terms is, as has already been intimated, that they
constitute an universal language, by means of which <span class="pagenum" id="page320">320</span>
cultivated persons in every country may convey to
each other their ideas without the need of translation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the advantage of indigenous
terms is, that so far as the language extends, they are
intelligible much more clearly and vividly than those
borrowed from any other source, as well as more easily
manageable in the construction of sentences. In the
descriptive language of botany, for example, in an
English work, the terms <i>drooping</i>, <i>nodding</i>, <i>one-sided</i>,
<i>twining</i>, <i>straggling</i>, appear better than
<i>cernuous</i>, <i>nutant</i>, <i>secund</i>, <i>volubile</i>,
<i>divaricate</i>. For though the
latter terms may by habit become as intelligible as the
former, they cannot become more so to any readers;
and to most English readers they will give a far less
distinct impression.</p>
<p id="b4a20a2">2. Since the advantage of indigenous over learned
terms, or the contrary, depends upon the balance of
the capacity of inflexion and composition on the one
hand, against a ready and clear significance on the
other, it is evident that the employment of scientific
terms of the one class or of the other may very properly
be extremely different in different languages.
The German possesses in a very eminent degree that
power of composition and derivation, which in English
can hardly be exercised at all, in a formal manner.
Hence German scientific writers use native terms to
a far greater extent than do our own authors. The
descriptive terminology of botany, and even the systematic
nomenclature of chemistry, are represented
by the Germans by means of German roots and inflexions.
Thus the description of <i>Potentilla anserina</i>,
in English botanists, is that it has <i>Leaves interruptedly
pinnate</i>, <i>serrate</i>, <i>silky</i>, <i>stem creeping</i>, <i>stalks axilllar</i>,
<i>one-flowered</i>. Here we have words of Saxon and
Latin origin mingled pretty equally. But the German
description is entirely Teutonic. <i>Die Blume in Achsel</i>;
<i>die Blätter unterbrochen gefiedert</i>, <i>die Blättchen scharf
gesagt</i>, <i>die Stämme kriechend</i>, <i>die Bluthenstiele
einblumig</i>. We could imitate this in our own language, by
saying <i>brokenly-feathered</i>, <i>sharp-sawed</i>; by using <i>threed</i>
for <i>ternate</i>, as the Germans employ <i>gedreit</i>; by saying <span class="pagenum" id="page321">321</span>
<i>fingered-feathered</i> for <i>digitato-pinnate</i>, and the like.
But the habit which we have, in common as well as
scientific language, of borrowing words from the Latin
for new cases, would make such usages seem very
harsh and pedantic.</p>
<p>We may add that, in consequence of these different
practices in the two languages, it is a common habit
of the German reader to impose a scientific definiteness
upon a common word, such as our <a href="#a5">Fifth</a> Aphorism
requires; whereas the English reader expects rather
that a word which is to have a technical sense shall be
derived from the learned languages. <i>Die Kelch</i> and
<i>die Blume</i> (the cup and the flower) easily assume the
technical meaning of <i>calyx</i> and <i>corolla</i>; <i>die Griffel</i>
(the pencil) becomes <i>the pistil</i>; and a name is easily
found for the <i>pollen</i>, the <i>anthers</i>, and the <i>stamens</i>, by
calling them the dust, the dust-cases, and the dust-threads
(<i>der Staub</i>, <i>die Staub-beutel</i>, or <i>Staub-fächer</i>,
and <i>die Staub-fäden</i>), This was formerly done in
English to a greater extent than is now possible without
confusion and pedantry. Thus, in Grew’s book on
the <i>Anatomy of Plants</i>, the calyx is called the
<i>impalement</i>, and the sepals the <i>impalers</i>; the petals are called
the <i>leaves of the flower</i>; the stamens with their anthers
are the <i>seminiform attire</i>. But the English language,
as to such matters, is now less flexible than it was;
partly in consequence of its having adopted the Linnæan
terminology almost entire, without any endeavour to
naturalize it. Any attempt at idiomatic description
would interfere with the scientific language
now generally received in this country. In Germany,
on the other hand, those who first wrote upon science
in their own language imitated the Latin words which
they found in foreign writers, instead of transferring
new roots into their own language. Thus the <i>Numerator</i>
and <i>Denominator</i> of a fraction they call the
<i>Namer</i> and the <i>Counter</i> (<i>Nenner</i> and <i>Zähler</i>). This
course they pursued even where the expression was
erroneous. Thus that portion of the intestines which
ancient anatomists called <i>Duodenum</i>, because they
falsely estimated its length at twelve inches, the <span class="pagenum" id="page322">322</span>
Germans also term <i>Zwölffingerdarm</i> (twelve-inch-gut),
though this intestine in a whale is twenty feet long,
and in a frog not above twenty lines. As another
example of this process in German, we may take the
word <i>Muttersackbauchblatte</i>, the <i>uterine peritonæum</i>.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable evidence of this formative power
of the German language, that it should have been
able to produce an imitation of the systematic chemical
nomenclature of the French school, so complete,
that it is used in Germany as familiarly as the original
system is in France and England. Thus Oxygen
and Hydrogen are <i>Sauerstoff</i> and
<span class="correction" title="emended from Wafferstoff"><i>Wasserstoff</i></span>; Azote is
<i>Stickstoff</i> (suffocating matter); Sulphuric and Sulphurous
Acid are <i>Schwefel-säure</i> and <i>Schwefelichte-säure</i>.
The Sulphate and Sulphite of Baryta, and Sulphuret
of Baryum, are <i>Schwefel-säure Baryterde</i>, <i>Schwefelichte-säure
Baryterde</i>, and <i>Schwefel-baryum</i>. Carbonate of
Iron is <i>Kohlen-säures Eisenoxydul</i>; and we may observe
that, in such cases, the German name is much
more agreeable to analogy than the English one; for
the Protoxide of Iron, (<i>Eisenoxydul</i>,) and not the
Iron itself, is the base of the salt. And the German
language has not only thus imitated the established
nomenclature of chemistry, but has shown itself capable
of supplying new forms to meet the demands
which the progress of theory occasions. Thus the
Hydracids are <i>Wasserstoff-säuren</i>; and of these, the
Hydriodic Acid is <i>Iodwasserstoff-säure</i>, and so of the
rest. In like manner, the translator of Berzelius has
found German names for the sulpho-salts of that
chemist; thus he has <i>Wasserstoffschwefliges Schewefellithium</i>,
which would be (if we were to adopt his
theoretical view) hydro-sulphuret of sulphuret of
lithium: and a like nomenclature for all other similar
cases.</p>
<p id="b4a20a3">3. In English we have no power of imitating this
process, and must take our technical phrases from
some more flexible language, and generally from the
Latin or Greek. We are indeed so much accustomed
to do this, that except a word has its origin in one of
these languages, it hardly seems to us a technical <span class="pagenum" id="page323">323</span>
term; and thus by employing indigenous terms, even
descriptive ones, we may, perhaps, lose in precision
more than we gain in the vividness of the impression.
Perhaps it may be better to say <i>cuneate</i>, <i>lunate</i>, <i>hastate</i>,
<i>sagittate</i>, <i>reniform</i>, than <i>wedge-shaped</i>, <i>crescent-shaped</i>,
<i>halbert-headed</i>, <i>arrow-headed</i>, <i>kidney-shaped</i>.
<i>Ringent</i> and <i>personate</i> are better than any English
words which we could substitute for them; <i>labiate</i> is
more precise than <i>lipped</i> would readily become.
<i>Urceolate</i>, <i>trochlear</i>, are more compact than <i>pitcher-shaped</i>,
<i>pulley-shaped</i>; and <i>infundibuliform</i>, <i>hypocrateriform</i>,
though long words, are not more inconvenient than
<i>funnel-shaped</i> and <i>salver-shaped</i>. In the same way it
is better to speak (with Dr.
Prichard<a id="fnanchor57-4" href="#note57-4"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a>,)
of <i>repent</i> and
<i>progressive</i> animals, than of <i>creeping</i> and progressive:
the two Latin terms make a better pair of correlatives.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-4" href="#fnanchor57-4">57</a></span>
<i>Researches</i>, p. 69.
</div>
<p id="b4a20a4">4. But wherever we may draw the line between
the proper use of English and Latin terms in descriptive
phraseology, we shall find it advisable to borrow
almost all other technical terms from the learned languages.
We have seen this in considering the new
terms introduced into various sciences in virtue of our
<a href="#a9">Ninth</a> Maxim. We may add, as further examples,
the names of the various animals of which a knowledge
has been acquired from the remains of them
which exist in various strata, and which have been
reconstructed by Cuvier and his successors. Such are
the <i>Palæotherium</i>, the <i>Anoplotherium</i>, the <i>Megatherium</i>,
the <i>Dinotherium</i>, the <i>Chirotherium</i>, the <i>Megalichthys</i>,
the <i>Mastodon</i>, the <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, the <i>Plesiosaurus</i>,
the <i>Pterodactylus</i>. To these others are every
year added; as, for instance, very recently, the
<i>Toxodon</i>, <i>Zeuglodon</i>, and <i>Phascolotherium</i> of Mr. Owen,
and the <i>Thylacotherium</i> of M. Valenciennes. Still
more recently the terms <i>Glyptodon</i>, <i>Mylodon</i>, <i>Dicynodon</i>,
<i>Paloplotherium</i>, <i>Rhynchosaurus</i>, have been added
by Mr. Owen to designate fossil animals newly determined by him. <span class="pagenum" id="page324">324</span></p>
<p>The names of species, as well as of genera, are thus
formed from the Greek: as the Plesiosaurus <i>dolichodeirus</i>
(long-necked), Ichthyosaurus <i>platyodon</i> (broad-toothed),
the Irish elk, termed Cervus <i>megaceros</i>
(large-horned). But the descriptive specific names are
also taken from the Latin, as Plesiosaurus <i>brevirostris</i>,
<i>longirostris</i>, <i>crassirostris</i>; besides which there are
arbitrary specific names, which we do not here consider.</p>
<p>These names being all constructed at a period when
naturalists were familiar with an artificial system, the
standard language of which is Latin, have not been
taken from modern language. But the names of living
animals, and even of their classes, long ago formed in
the common language of men, have been in part adopted
in the systems of naturalists, agreeably to Aphorism
<a href="#a3">Third</a>. Hence the language of systems in natural
history is mixed of ancient and modern languages.
Thus Cuvier’s divisions of the vertebrated animals are
<i>Mammifères</i> (Latin), <i>Oiseaux</i>, <i>Reptiles</i>,
<i>Poissons</i>; <i>Bimanes</i>, <i>Quadrumanes</i>, <i>Carnassières</i>,
<i>Rongeurs</i>, <i>Pachydermes</i> (Greek), <i>Ruminans</i> (Latin),
<i>Cétacés</i> (Latin). In
the subordinate divisions the distribution being more
novel, the names are less idiomatic: thus the kinds of
Reptiles are <i>Cheloniens</i>, <i>Sauriens</i>, <i>Ophidiens</i>, <i>Batraciens</i>,
all which are of Greek origin. In like manner.
Fish are divided into <i>Chondropterygiens</i>, <i>Malacopterygiens</i>,
<i>Acanthopterygiens</i>. The unvertebrated animals
are <i>Mollusques</i>, <i>Animaux articulés</i>, and <i>Animaux
rayonnés</i>; and the Mollusques are divided into six classes,
chiefly according to the position or form of their foot;
namely, <i>Cephalopodes</i>, <i>Pteropodes</i>, <i>Gasteropodes</i>,
<i>Acephales</i>, <i>Brachiopodes</i>, <i>Cirrhopodes</i>.</p>
<p>In transferring these terms into English, when the
term is new in French as well as English, we have
little difficulty; for we may take nearly the same
liberties in English which are taken in French; and
hence we may say <i>mammifers</i> (rather <i>mammals</i>), <i>cetaceans</i>
or <i>cetaces</i>, <i>batracians</i> (rather <i>batrachians</i>), using
the words as substantives. But in other cases we
must go back to the Latin: thus we say <i>radiate</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page325">325</span> animals,
or <i>radiata</i> (rather <i>radials</i>), for <i>rayonnés</i>. These
changes, however, rather refer to another Aphorism.</p>
<p>(Mr. Kirby has proposed <i>radiary</i>, <i>radiaries</i>, for
<i>radiata</i>.)</p>
<p id="b4a20a5">5. When new Mineral Species have been established
in recent times, they have generally had arbitrary
names assigned to them, derived from some person or
places. In some instances, however, descriptive names
have been selected; and then these have been generally
taken from the Greek, as <i>Augite</i>, <i>Stilbite</i>, <i>Diaspore</i>,
<i>Dichroite</i>, <i>Dioptase</i>. Several of these Greek names
imposed by Haüy, refer to some circumstances, often
fancifully selected, in his view of the crystallization of
the substance, as <i>Epidote</i>, <i>Peridote</i>, <i>Pleonast</i>. Similar
terms of Greek origin have been introduced by others,
as <i>Orthite</i>, <i>Anorthite</i>, <i>Periklin</i>. Greek names founded
on casual circumstances are less to be commended.
Berzelius has termed a mineral <i>Eschynite</i> from
<span class="greek">αἰσχυνὴ</span>, <i>shame</i>, because it is, he conceives, a shame for
chemists not to have separated its elements more distinctly
than they did at first.</p>
<p id="b4a20a6">6. In Botany, the old names of genera of Greek origin
are very numerous, and many of them are descriptive,
as <i>Glycyrhiza</i> (<span class="greek">γλυκὺς</span>
and <span class="greek">ῥιζα</span>, sweet root) liquorice,
<i>Rhododendron</i> (rose-tree), <i>Hæmatoxylon</i> (bloody
wood), <i>Chrysocoma</i> (golden hair), <i>Alopecurus</i> (fox-tail),
and many more. In like manner there are names
which derive a descriptive significance from the Latin,
either adjectives, as <i>Impatiens</i>, <i>Gloriosa</i>, <i>Sagittaria</i>,
or substantives irregularly formed, as <i>Tussilago</i> (à
tussis domatione), <i>Urtica</i> (ab urendo tactu), <i>Salsola</i>
(à salsedine). But these, though good names when they
are established by tradition, are hardly to be imitated
in naming new plants. In most instances, when this
is to be done, arbitrary or local names have been
selected, as <i>Strelitzia</i>.</p>
<p id="b4a20a7">7. In Chemistry, new substances have of late had
names assigned them from Greek roots, as <i>Iodine</i>, from
its violet colour, <i>Chlorine</i> from its green colour. In
like manner fluorine has by the French chemists been
called <i>Phthor</i>, from its destructive properties. So the <span class="pagenum" id="page326">326</span>
new metals, <i>Chrome</i>, <i>Rhodium</i>, <i>Iridium</i>, <i>Osmium</i>, had
names of Greek derivation descriptive of their properties.
Some such terms, however, were borrowed from
localities, as <i>Strontia</i>, <i>Yttria</i>, the names of new earths.
Others have a mixed origin, as <i>Pyrogallic</i>, <i>Pyroacetic</i>,
and <i>Pyroligneous</i> Spirit. In some cases the derivation
has been extravagantly capricious. Thus in the process for
making Pyrogallic Acid, a certain substance is
left behind, from which M. Braconnot extracted an
acid which he called <i>Ellagic</i> Acid, framing the root of
the name by reading the word <i>Galle</i> backwards.</p>
<p>The new laws which the study of Electro-chemistry
brought into view, required a new terminology to express
their conditions: and in this case, as we have
observed in speaking of the <a href="#a12">Twelfth</a> Maxim, arbitrary
words are less suitable. Mr. Faraday very properly
borrowed from the Greek his terms <i>Electrolyte</i>, <i>Electrode</i>,
<i>Anode</i>, <i>Cathode</i>, <i>Anïon</i>, <i>Cathïon</i>, <i>Dielectric</i>. In
the mechanico-chemical and mechanical sciences, however,
new terms are less copiously required than in the
sciences of classification, and when they are needed,
they are generally determined by analogy from existing
terms. <i>Thermo-electricity</i> and <i>Electro-dynamics</i> were
terms which very naturally offered themselves; Nobili’s
<i>thermo-multiplier</i>, Snow Harris’s <i>unit-jar</i>, were
almost equally obvious names. In such cases, it is
generally possible to construct terms both compendious
and descriptive, without introducing any new radical
words.</p>
<p id="b4a20a8">8. The subject of Crystallography has inevitably
given rise to many new terms, since it brings under
our notice a great number of new relations of a very
definite but very complex form. Haüy attempted
to find names for all the leading varieties of crystals,
and for this purpose introduced a great number of
new terms, founded on various analogies and allusions.
Thus the forms of calc-spar are termed by him <i>primitive</i>,
<i>equiaxe</i>, <i>inverse</i>, <i>metastatique</i>, <i>contrastante</i>, <i>imitable</i>,
<i>birhomboidale</i>, <i>prismatique</i>, <i>apophane</i>, <i>uniternaire</i>,
<i>bisunitaire</i>, <i>dodécaèdre</i>, <i>contractée</i>, <i>dilatée</i>, <i>sexduodecimale</i>,
<i>bisalterne</i>, <i>binoternaire</i>, and many others.
The <span class="pagenum" id="page327">327</span>
want of uniformity in the origin and scheme of these
denominations would be no valid objection to them, if
any general truth could be expressed by means of
them: but the fact is, that there is no definite
distinction of these forms. They pass into each other
by insensible gradations, and the optical and physical
properties which they possess are common to all of
them. And as a mere enunciation of laws of form,
this terminology is insufficient. Thus it does not at
all convey the relation between the <i>bisalterne</i> and the
<i>binoternaire</i>, the former being a combination of the
<i>metastatique</i> with the <i>prismatique</i>, the latter, of the
<i>metastatique</i> with the <i>contrastante</i>: again,
the <i>contrastante</i>, the <i>mixte</i>, the <i>cuboide</i>,
the <i>contractée</i>, the <i>dilatée</i>, all contain
faces generated by a common law, the
index being respectively altered so as to be in these
cases, 3, <span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span>,
<span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></span>,
<span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span>,
<span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub></span>;
and this, which is the most
important geometrical relation of these forms, is not at
all recorded or indicated by the nomenclature. The
fact is, that it is probably impossible, the subject of
crystallography having become so complex as it now is,
to devise a system of names which shall express the
relations of form. Numerical symbols, such as those
of Weiss or Naumann, or Professor Miller, are the
proper ways of expressing these relations, and are the
only good crystallographic terminology for cases in
detail.</p>
<p>The terms used in expressing crystallographic laws
have been for the most part taken from the Greek by
all writers except some of the Germans. These, we
have already stated, have constructed terms in their
own language, as <i>zwei-und-ein gliedrig</i>, and the like.</p>
<p>In Optics we have some new terms connected with
crystalline laws, as <i>uniaxal</i> and <i>biaxal</i> crystals, <i>optical
axes</i>, which offered themselves without any effort on
the part of the discoverers. In the whole history of
the undulatory theory, very few innovations in language
were found necessary, except to fix the sense of
a few phrases, as <i>plane-polarized</i> light in opposition to
<i>circularly-polarized</i>, and the like.</p>
<p>This is still more the case in Mechanics, Astronomy, <span class="pagenum" id="page328">328</span>
and pure mathematics. In these sciences, several of
the primary stages of generalization being already
passed over, when any new steps are made, we have
before us some analogy by which we may frame our
new terms. Thus when the <i>plane of maximum areas</i>
was discovered, it had not some new arbitrary denomination
assigned it, but the name which obviously described
it was fixed as a technical name.</p>
<p>The result of this survey of the scientific terms of
recent formation seems to be this;&mdash;that indigenous
terms may be employed in the descriptions of facts
and phenomena as they at first present themselves;
and in the first induction from these; but that when
we come to generalize and theorize, terms borrowed
from the learned languages are more readily fixed and
made definite, and are also more easily connected with
derivatives. Our native terms are more impressive,
and at first more intelligible; but they may wander
from their scientific meaning, and are capable of little
inflexion. Words of classical origin are precise to the
careful student, and capable of expressing, by their
inflexions, the relations of general ideas; but they are
unintelligible, even to the learned man, without express
definition, and convey instruction only through
an artificial and rare habit of thought.</p>
<p class="end">Since in the balance between words of domestic and
of foreign origin so much depends upon the possibility
of inflexion and derivation, I shall consider a little
more closely what are the limits and considerations
which we have to take into account in reference to
that subject.</p>
<p class="center" id="a21"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXI.</p>
<p><i>In the composition and inflexion of technical terms, philological
analogies are to be preserved if possible, but modified
according to scientific convenience.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> the language employed or proposed by writers
upon subjects of science, many combinations and forms
of derivation occur, which would be rejected and condemned
by those who are careful of the purity and <span class="pagenum" id="page329">329</span>
correctness of language. Such anomalies are to be
avoided as much as possible; but it is impossible to
escape them altogether, if we are to have a scientific
language which has any chance of being received into
general use. It is better to admit compounds which
are not philologically correct, than to invent many
new words, all strange to the readers for whom they
are intended: and in writing on science in our own
language, it is not possible to avoid making additions
to the vocabulary of common life; since science requires
exact names for many things which common
language has not named. And although these new
names should, as much as possible, be constructed in
conformity with the analogies of the language, such
extensions of analogy can hardly sound, to the grammarian’s
ear, otherwise than as solecisms. But, as our
maxim indicates, the analogy of science is of more
weight with us than the analogy of language: and although
anomalies in our phraseology should be avoided
as much as possible, innovations must be permitted
wherever a scientific language, easy to acquire, and
convenient to use, is unattainable without them.</p>
<p>I shall proceed to mention some of the transgressions
of strict philological rules, and some of the
extensions of grammatical forms, which the above
conditions appear to render necessary.</p>
<p id="b4a21a1">1. The combination of different languages in the
derivation of words, though to be avoided in general,
is in some cases admissible.</p>
<p>Such words are condemned by Quintilian and other
grammarians, under the name of hybrids, or things of a
mixed race; as <i>biclinium</i> from <i>bis</i> and <span class="greek">κλίνη</span>; <i>epitogium</i>,
from <span class="greek">ἐπὶ</span> and <i>toga</i>. Nor are such terms to be
unnecessarily introduced in science. Whenever a homogeneous
word can be formed and adopted with the
same ease and convenience as a hybrid, it is to be preferred.
Hence we must have <i>ichthyology</i>, not <i>piscology</i>,
<i>entomology</i>, not <i>insectology</i>, <i>insectivorous</i>,
not <i>insectophagous</i>. In like manner, it would be better to say
<i>unoculus</i> than <i>monoculus</i>, though the latter has the
sanction of Linnæus, who was a purist in such matters. <span class="pagenum" id="page330">330</span>
Dr. Turner, in his <i>Chemistry</i>, speaks of <i>protoxides</i> and
<i>binoxides</i>, which combination violates the rule for
making the materials of our terms as homogeneous as
possible; <i>protoxide</i> and <i>deutoxide</i> would be preferable,
both on this and on other accounts.</p>
<p>Yet this rule admits of exceptions. <i>Mineralogy</i>,
with its Greek termination, has for its root <i>minera</i>, a
medieval Latin word of Teutonic origin, and is preferable
to <i>Oryctology</i>. <i>Terminology</i> appears to be better
than <i>Glossology</i>: which according to its derivation
would be rather the science of language in general
than of technical terms; and <i>Horology</i>, from <span class="greek">ὅρος</span>, a
term, would not be immediately intelligible, even to
Greek scholars; and is already employed to indicate
the science which treats of horologes, or time-pieces.</p>
<p>Indeed, the English reader is become quite familiar
with the termination <i>ology</i>, the names of a large
number of branches of science and learning having that
form. This termination is at present rather apprehended
as a formative affix in our own language, indicating a science,
than as an element borrowed from
foreign language. Hence, when it is difficult or impossible
to find a Greek term which clearly designates
the subject of a science, it is allowable to employ some
other, as in <i>Tidology</i>, the doctrine of the Tides.</p>
<p>The same remark applies to some other Greek elements of
scientific words: they are so familiar to us
that in composition they are almost used as part of
our own language. This naturalization has taken
place very decidedly in the element <i>arch</i>, (<span class="greek">ἀρχὸς</span> a
leader,) as we see in <i>archbishop</i>, <i>archduke</i>. It is
effected in a great degree for the preposition <i>anti</i>: thus
we speak of <i>anti-slavery</i> societies, <i>anti-reformers</i>,
<i>anti-bilious</i>, or <i>anti-acid</i> medicines, without being conscious
of any anomaly. The same is the case with the Latin
preposition <i>præ</i> or <i>pre</i>, as appears from such words as
<i>pre-engage</i>, <i>pre-arrange</i>, <i>pre-judge</i>, <i>pre-paid</i>; and in
some measure with <i>pro</i>, for in colloquial language we
speak of <i>pro-catholics</i> and <i>anti-catholics</i>. Also the
preposition <i>ante</i> is similarly used, as <i>ante-nicene</i> fathers.
The preposition <i>co</i>, abbreviated from <i>con</i>, and <span class="pagenum" id="page331">331</span> implying
things to be simultaneous or connected, is firmly
established as part of the language, as we see in <i>coexist</i>,
<i>coheir</i>, <i>coordinate</i>; hence I have called those lines
<i>cotidal</i> lines which pass through places where the high
water of the tide occurs simultaneously.</p>
<p id="b4a21a2">2. As in the course of the mixture by which our
language has been formed, we have thus lost all
habitual consciousness of the difference of its ingredients,
(Greek, Latin, Norman-French, and Anglo-Saxon): we
have also ceased to confine to each ingredient the mode
of grammatical inflexion which originally belonged to
it. Thus the termination <i>ive</i> belongs peculiarly to
Latin adjectives, yet we say <i>sportive</i>, <i>talkative</i>. In
like manner, <i>able</i> is added to words which are not
Latin, as <i>eatable</i>, <i>drinkable</i>, <i>pitiable</i>, <i>enviable</i>. Also
the termination <i>al</i> and <i>ical</i> are used with various roots,
as <i>loyal</i>, <i>royal</i>, <i>farcical</i>, <i>whimsical</i>; hence we may
make the adjective <i>tidal</i> from <i>tide</i>. This ending, <i>al</i>,
is also added to abstract terms in <i>ion</i>, as <i>occasional</i>,
<i>provisional</i>, <i>intentional</i>, <i>national</i>; hence we may, if
necessary, use such words as <i>educational</i>, <i>terminational</i>.
The ending <i>ic</i> appears to be suited to proper
names, as <i>Pindaric</i>, <i>Socratic</i>, <i>Platonic</i>; hence it may
be used when scientific words are derived from proper
names, as <i>Voltaic</i> or <i>Galvanic</i> electricity: to which I
have proposed to add <i>Franklinic</i>.</p>
<p>In adopting scientific adjectives from the Latin, we
have not much room for hesitation; for, in such cases,
the habits of derivation from that language into our
own are very constant; <i>ivus</i> becomes <i>ive</i>, as <i>decursive</i>;
<i>inus</i> becomes <i>ine</i>, as in <i>ferine</i>; <i>atus</i> becomes <i>ate</i>, as
<i>hastate</i>; and <i>us</i> often becomes <i>ous</i>, as <i>rufous</i>; <i>aris</i>
becomes <i>ary</i>, as <i>axillary</i>; <i>ens</i> becomes <i>ent</i>, as <i>ringent</i>.
And in adopting into our language, as scientific terms,
words which in another language, the French for instance,
have a Latin origin familiar to us, we cannot
do better than form them as if they were derived
directly from the Latin. Hence the French adjectives
<i>cétacé</i>, <i>crustacé</i>, <i>testacé</i>, may become either <i>cetaceous</i>,
<i>crustaceous</i>, <i>testaceous</i>, according to the analogy of
<i>farinaceous</i>, <i>predaceous</i>, or else <i>cetacean</i>,
<i>crustacean</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page332">332</span>
<i>testacean</i>, imitating the form of <i>patrician</i>. Since, as
I shall soon have to notice, we require substantives as
well as adjectives from these words, we must, at least
for that use, take the forms last suggested.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the same remark, <i>rongeur</i> becomes
<i>rodent</i>; and <i>edenté</i> would become <i>edentate</i>, but that
this word is rejected on another account: the adjectives
<i>bimane</i> and <i>quadrumane</i> are <i>bimanous</i> and
<i>quadrumanous</i>.</p>
<p id="b4a21a3">3. There is not much difficulty in thus forming
adjectives: but the purposes of Natural History require
that we should have substantives corresponding
to these adjectives; and these cannot be obtained without
some extension of the analogies of our language.
We cannot in general use adjectives or participles as
singular substantives. <i>The happy</i> or <i>the doomed</i> would,
according to good English usage, signify those who are
happy and those who are doomed in the plural. Hence
we could not speak of a particular scaled animal as <i>the
squamate</i>, and still less could we call any such animal
<i>a squamate</i>, or speak of <i>squamates</i> in the plural. Some
of the forms of our adjectives, however, do admit of
this substantive use. Thus we talk of <i>Europeans</i>, <i>plebeians</i>,
<i>republicans</i>; of <i>divines</i> and <i>masculines</i>; of the
<i>ultramontanes</i>; of <i>mordants</i> and <i>brilliants</i>;
of <i>abstergents</i> and <i>emollients</i>;
of <i>mercenaries</i> and <i>tributaries</i>;
of <i>animals</i>, <i>mammals</i>, and <i>officials</i>; of <i>dissuasives</i> and
<i>motives</i>. We cannot generally use in this way adjectives
in <i>ous</i>, nor in <i>ate</i> (though <i>reprobates</i> is an exception),
nor English participles, nor adjectives in which there
is no termination imitating the Latin, as <i>happy</i>, <i>good</i>.
Hence, if we have, for purposes of science, to convert
adjectives into substantives, we ought to follow the
form of examples like these, in which it has already
appeared in fact, that such usage, though an innovation
at first, may ultimately become a received part of
the language.</p>
<p>By attention to this rule we may judge what expressions
to select in cases where substantives are
needed. I will take as an example the division of
the mammalian animals into Orders. These Orders, <span class="pagenum" id="page333">333</span>
according to Cuvier, are <i>Bimanes</i>, <i>Quadrumanes</i>, <i>Carnassiers</i>,
<i>Rongeurs</i>, <i>Edentés</i>, <i>Ruminants</i>, <i>Pachydermes</i>,
<i>Cétacés</i>; and of these, <i>Bimanes</i>, <i>Quadrumanes</i>, <i>Rodents</i>,
<i>Ruminants</i>, <i>Pachyderms</i> are admissible as English substantives
on the grounds just stated. <i>Cetaceous</i>
could not be used substantively; but <i>Cetacean</i> in such
a usage is sufficiently countenanced by such cases as
we have mentioned, <i>patrician</i>, &amp;c.; hence we adopt
this form. We have no English word equivalent to
the French <i>Carnassiers</i>: the English translator of
Cuvier has not provided English words for his technical
terms; but has formed a Latin word, <i>Carnaria</i>,
to represent the French terms. From this we might
readily form <i>Carnaries</i>; but it appears much better to
take the Linnæan name <i>Feræ</i> as our root, from which
we may take <i>Ferine</i>, substantive as well as adjective;
and hence we call this order <i>Ferines</i>. The word for
which it is most difficult to provide a proper representation
is <i>Edenté</i>, <i>Edentata</i>: for, as we have said, it
would be very harsh to speak of the order as the
<i>Edentates</i>; and if we were to abbreviate the word
into <i>edent</i>, we should suggest a false analogy with
<i>rodent</i>, for as <i>rodent</i> is <i>quod rodit</i>, that which gnaws,
<i>edent</i> would be <i>quod edit</i>, that which eats. And even
if we were to take <i>edent</i> as a substantive, we could
hardly use it as an adjective: we should still have to
say, for example, the <i>edentate</i> form of head. For these
reasons it appears best to alter the form of the word,
and to call the Order the <i>Edentals</i>, which is quite
allowable, both as adjective and substantive.</p>
<p>[An objection might be made to this term, both in
its Latin, French and English form: namely, that the
natural group to which it is applied includes many
species, both existing and extinct, well provided with
teeth. Thus the armadillo is remarkable for the number
of its teeth; the megatherium, for their complex
structure. But the analogy of scientific language
readily permits us to fix, upon the word <i>edentata</i>, a
special meaning, implying the absence of one particular
kind of teeth, namely, incisive teeth. Linnæus
called the equivalent order <i>Bruta</i>. We could not <span class="pagenum" id="page334">334</span>
apply in this case the term <i>Brutes</i>; for common
language has already attached to the word a wider meaning,
too fixedly for scientific use to trifle with it.]</p>
<p>There are several other words in <i>ate</i> about which
there is the same difficulty in providing substantive
forms. Are we to speak of <i>Vertebrates</i>? or would it
not be better, in agreement with what has been said
above, to call these <i>Vertebrals</i>, and the opposite class
<i>Invertebrals</i>?</p>
<p>There are similar difficulties with regard to the
names of subordinate portions of zoological classification;
thus the Ferines are divided by Cuvier into
<i>Cheiroptéres</i>, <i>Insectivores</i>, <i>Carnivores</i>; and these latter
into <i>Plantigrades</i>, <i>Digitigrades</i>, <i>Amphibies</i>, <i>Marsupiaux</i>.
There is not any great harshness in naturalizing
these substantives as <i>Chiropters</i>, <i>Insectivores</i>, <i>Carnivores</i>,
<i>Plantigrades</i>, <i>Digitigrades</i>, <i>Amphibians</i>, and
<i>Marsupials</i>. These words <i>Carnivores</i> and <i>Insectivores</i>
are better, because of more familiar origin, than Greek
terms; otherwise we might, if necessary, speak of
<i>Zoophagans</i> and <i>Entomophagans</i>.</p>
<p>It is only with certain familiar adjectival terminations,
as <i>ous</i> and <i>ate</i>, that there is a difficulty in using
the word as substantive. When this can be avoided,
we readily accept the new word, as <i>Pachyderms</i>, and
in like manner <i>Mollusks</i>.</p>
<p>If we examine the names of the Orders of Birds, we
find that they are in Latin, <i>Predatores</i> or <i>Accipitres</i>,
<i>Passeres</i>, <i>Scansores</i>, <i>Rasores</i> or <i>Gallinæ</i>, <i>Grallatores</i>,
<i>Palmipedes</i> and <i>Anseres</i>: Cuvier’s Orders are, <i>Oiseaux
de Proie</i>, <i>Passereaux</i>, <i>Grimpeurs</i>, <i>Gallinacés</i>, <i>Échassiers</i>,
<i>Palmipedes</i>. These may be englished conveniently as <i>Predators</i>,
<i>Passerines</i>, <i>Scansors</i>, <i>Gallinaceans</i>,
(rather than <i>Rasors</i>,) <i>Grallators</i>, <i>Palmipedans</i>, [or
rather <i>Palmipeds</i>, like <i>Bipeds</i>]. <i>Scansors</i>, <i>Grallators</i>,
and <i>Rasors</i>, are better, as technical terms, than <i>Climbers</i>,
<i>Waders,</i> and <i>Scratchers</i>. We might venture to
anglicize the terminations of the names which Cuvier
gives to the divisions of these Orders: thus the Predators
are the <i>Diurnals</i> and the <i>Nocturnals</i>; the
Passerines are the <i>Dentirostres</i>, the
<i>Fissirostres</i>, the <span class="pagenum" id="page335">335</span>
<i>Conirostres</i>, the <i>Tenuirostres</i>, and the <i>Syndactyls</i>: the
word <i>lustre</i> showing that the former termination is
allowable. The Scansors are not sub-divided, nor are
the Gallinaceans. The Grallators are <i>Pressirostres</i>,
<i>Cultrirostres</i>, <i>Macrodactyls</i>. The Palmipeds are the
<i>Plungers</i>, the <i>Longipens</i>, the <i>Totipalmes</i> and the
<i>Lamellirostres</i>.</p>
<p>The next class of Vertebrals is the <i>Reptiles</i>, and
these are either <i>Chelonians</i>, <i>Saurians</i>, <i>Ophidians</i>, or
<i>Batrachians</i>. Cuvier writes <i>Batraciens</i>, but we prefer
the spelling to which the Greek word directs us.</p>
<p>The last or lowest class is the <i>Fishes</i>, in which province
Cuvier has himself been the great systematist,
and has therefore had to devise many new terms.
Many of these are of Greek or Latin origin, and can
be anglicized by the analogies already pointed out, as
<i>Chondropterygians</i>, <i>Malacopterygians</i>, <i>Lophobranchs</i>,
<i>Plectognaths</i>, <i>Gymnodonts</i>, <i>Scleroderms</i>. <i>Discoboles</i> and
<i>Apodes</i> may be English as well as French. There are
other cases in which the author has formed the names
of Families, either by forming a word in <i>ides</i> from the
name of a genus, as <i>Gadoides</i>, <i>Gobiöides</i>, or by
gallicizing the Latin name of the genus, as <i>Salmones</i> from
<i>Salmo</i>, <i>Clupes</i> from <i>Clupea</i>, <i>Ésoces</i> from <i>Esox</i>, <i>Cyprins</i>
from <i>Cyprinus</i>. In these cases Agassiz’s favourite form
of names for families of fishes has led English writers
to use the words <i>Gadoids</i>, <i>Gobioids</i>, <i>Salmonoids</i>,
<i>Clupeoids</i>, <i>Lucioids</i> (for <i>Ésoces</i>), <i>Cyprinoids</i>, &amp;c. There is
a taint of hybridism in this termination, but it is attended
with this advantage, that it has begun to be
characteristic of the nomenclature of family groups in
the class <i>Pisces</i>. One of the orders of fishes,
co-ordinate with the Chondropterygians and the Lophobranchs,
is termed <i>Osseux</i> by Cuvier. It appears
hardly worth while to invent a substantive word for
this, when <i>Bony Fishes</i> is so simple a phrase, and may
readily be understood as a technical name of a systematic order.</p>
<p>The Mollusks are the next Class; and these are
divided into <i>Cephallopods</i>, <i>Gasteropods</i>, and the like.
The Gasteropods are <i>Nudibranchs</i>, <i>Inferobranchs</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="page336">336</span> <i>Tectibranchs,</i>
<i>Pectinibranchs</i>, <i>Scutibranchs</i>, and <i>Cyclobranchs</i>.
In framing most of these terms Cuvier has made hybrids
by a combination of a Latin word with <i>branchiæ</i>
which is the Greek name for the gills of a fish; and has
thus avoided loading the memory with words of an
origin not obvious to most naturalists, as terms derived
from the Greek would have been. Another division
of the Gasteropods is <i>Pulmonés</i>, which we must make
<i>Pulmonians</i>. In like manner the subdivisions of the
Pectinibranchs are the <i>Trochoidans</i> and <i>Buccinoidans</i>,
(<i>Trochoïdes</i>, <i>Buccinoïdes)</i>. The <i>Acéphales</i>, another order
of Mollusks, may be <i>Acephals</i> in English.</p>
<p>After these comes the third grand division, <i>Articulated
Animals</i>, and these are  <i>Annelidans</i>,  <i>Crustaceans,</i>
<i>Arachnidans</i>, and  <i>Insects</i>. I shall not dwell upon the
names of these, as the form of English words which is
to be selected must be sufficiently obvious from the
preceding examples.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the fourth grand division of animals,
the <i>Rayonnés</i>, or <i>Radiata</i>; which, for reasons already
given, we may call <i>Radials</i>, or <i>Radiaries</i>. These are
<i>Echinoderms</i>, <i>Intestinals</i>, (or rather <i>Entozoans</i>,) <i>Acalephes</i>,
and <i>Polyps</i>. The Polyps, which are composite
animals in which many gelatinous individuals are connected
so as to have a common life, have, in many cases,
a more solid framework belonging to the common part
of the animal. This framework, of which coral is a
special example, is termed in French <i>Polypier</i>; the
word has been anglicized by the word <i>polypary</i>, after
the analogy of <i>aviary</i> and <i>apiary</i>. Thus Polyps are
either <i>Polyps with Polyparies</i> or <i>Naked Polyps</i>.</p>
<p>Any common kind of Polyps has usually in the
English language been called <i>Polypus</i>, the Greek termination
being retained. This termination in <i>us</i>,
however, whether Latin or Greek, is to be excluded
from the English as much as possible, on account of
the embarrassment which it occasions in the formation
of the plural. For if we say <i>Polypi</i> the word ceases to
be English, while <i>Polypuses</i> is harsh: and there is the
additional inconvenience, that both these forms would
indicate the plural of individuals rather than of classes. <span class="pagenum" id="page337">337</span>
If we were to say, ‘The Corallines are a Family of the
<i>Polypuses with Polyparies</i>,’ it would not at once occur
to the reader that the last three words formed a technical phrase.</p>
<p>This termination <i>us</i> which must thus be excluded
from the names of families, may be admitted in the
designation of genera; of animals, as <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Echinus</i>,
<i>Hippopotamus</i>; and of plants, as <i>Crocus</i>, <i>Asparagus</i>,
<i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Acanthus</i>, <i>Ranunculus</i>, <i>Fungus</i>. The same
form occurs in other technical words, as <i>Fucus</i>, <i>Mucus</i>,
<i>Œsophagus</i>, <i>Hydrocephalus</i>, <i>Callus</i>, <i>Calculus</i>, <i>Uterus</i>,
<i>Fœtus</i>, <i>Radius</i>, <i>Focus</i>, <i>Apparatus</i>. It is, however,
advisable to retain this form only in cases where it is
already firmly established in the language; for a more
genuine English form is preferable. Hence we say,
with Mr. Lyell, <i>Ichthyosaur</i>, <i>Plesiosaur</i>, <i>Pterodactyl</i>. In
like manner Mr. Owen anglicizes the termination <i>erium</i>,
and speaks of the <i>Anoplothere</i> and <i>Paleothere</i>.</p>
<p>Since the wants of science thus demand adjectives
which can be used also as substantive names of classes,
this consideration may sometimes serve to determine
our selection of new terms. Thus Mr. Lyell’s names
for the subdivisions of the tertiary strata, <i>Miocene</i>, <i>Pliocene,</i>
can be used as substantives; but if such words as
<i>Mioneous</i>, <i>Plioneous</i>, had suggested themselves, they
must have been rejected, though of equivalent signification,
as not fulfilling this condition.</p>
<p id="b4a21a4">4. (<i>a.</i>) Abstract substantives can easily be formed
from adjectives: from electric we have <i>electricity</i>; from
galvanic, <i>galvanism</i>; from organic, <i>organization</i>;
<i>velocity</i>, <i>levity</i>, <i>gravity</i>, are borrowed from Latin adjectives.
<i>Caloric</i> is familiarly used for the matter of heat, though
the form of the word is not supported by any obvious
analogy.</p>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) It is intolerable to have words regularly
formed, in opposition to the analogy which their meaning
offers; as when bodies are said to have conduct<i>ibility</i>
or conduc<i>ibility</i> with regard to heat. The bodies
are conduct<i>ive</i>, and their property is conduct<i>ivity</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>c.</i>) The terminations <i>ize</i> (rather than <i>ise</i>), <i>ism</i>, and
<i>ist</i>, are applied to words of all origins:
thus we have to <span class="pagenum" id="page338">338</span>
<i>pulverize</i>, to <i>colonize</i>, <i>Witticism</i>, <i>Heathenism</i>, <i>Journalist</i>,
<i>Tobacconist</i>. Hence we may make such words when
they are wanted. As we cannot use <i>physician</i> for a
cultivator of physics, I have called him a <i>Physicist</i>.
We need very much a name to describe a cultivator of
science in general. I should incline to call him a
<i>Scientist</i>. Thus we might say, that as an Artist is a
Musician, Painter, or Poet, a Scientist is a Mathematician,
Physicist, or Naturalist.</p>
<p>(<i>d.</i>) Connected with verbs in <i>ize</i>, we have abstract
nouns in <i>ization</i>, as <i>polarization</i>, <i>crystallization</i>. These
it appears proper to spell in English with <i>z</i> rather than
<i>s</i>; governing our practice by the Greek verbal termination
<span class="greek">ίζω</span> which we imitate. But we must observe
that verbs and substantives in <i>yse</i>, (<i>analyse</i>), belong
to a different analogy, giving an abstract noun in <i>ysis</i>
and an adjective <i>ytic</i> or <i>ytical</i>; (<i>analysis</i>, <i>analytic</i>,
<i>analytical</i>). Hence <i>electrolyse</i> is more proper than
<i>electrolyze</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>e.</i>) The names of many sciences end in <i>ics</i> after
the analogy of <i>Mathematics</i>, <i>Metaphysics</i>; as <i>Optics</i>,
<i>Mechanics</i>. But these, in most other languages, as in
our own formerly, have the singular form <i>Optice</i>, <i>l’Optique</i>,
<i>Optik</i>, <i>Optick</i>: and though we now write <i>Optics</i>,
we make such words of the singular number: ‘Newton’s Opticks
is an example.’ As, however, this connexion in new words
is startling, as when we say
‘Thermo-electrics is now much cultivated,’ it appears
better to employ the singular form, after the analogy
of <i>Logic</i> and <i>Rhetoric</i>, when we have words
to construct. Hence we may call the science of languages
<i>Linguistic</i>, as it is called by the best German writers,
for instance, William Von Humboldt.</p>
<p id="b4a21a5">5. In the derivation of English from Latin or Greek
words, the changes of letters are to be governed by the
rules which have generally prevailed in such cases.
The Greek <span class="greek">οι</span> and <span class="greek">αι</span>,
the Latin <i>oe</i> and <i>ae</i>,
are all converted into a simple <i>e</i>, as in <i>E</i>conomy, Geod<i>e</i>sy, p<i>e</i>nal,
C<i>e</i>sar. Hence, according to common usage, we should
write ph<i>e</i>nomena, not ph<i>æ</i>nomena, pal<i>e</i>ontology, not
pal<i>æ</i>ontology, mioc<i>e</i>ne not mioc<i>æ</i>ne, p<i>e</i>kilite not
<span class="pagenum" id="page339">339</span> p<i>œ</i>kilite.
But in order to keep more clearly in view the
origin of our terms, it may be allowable to deviate from
these rules of change, especially so long as the words
are new and unfamiliar. Dr. Buckland speaks of the
<i>poikilitic</i>, not <i>pecilitic</i>, group of strata: <i>palæontology</i>
is the spelling commonly adopted; and in imitation of
this I have written <i>palætiology</i>. The diphthong <span class="greek">ει</span> was
by the Latins changed into <i>i</i>, as in Arist<i>i</i>des; and
hence this has been the usual form in English. Some
recent authors indeed (Mr. Mitford for instance) write
Arist<i>eid</i>es; but the former appears to be the more
legitimate. Hence we write m<i>i</i>ocene, pl<i>i</i>ocene, not
m<i>ei</i>ocene, pl<i>ei</i>ocene. The Greek <span class="greek">υ</span>
becomes <i>y</i>, and <span class="greek">ου</span>
becomes <i>u</i>, in English as in Latin, as cr<i>y</i>stal, col<i>u</i>re.
The consonants <span class="greek">κ</span> and <span class="greek">χ</span>
become <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i> according
to common usage. Hence we write <i>crystal</i>,
not <i>chrystal</i>, batra<i>ch</i>ian, not batra<i>c</i>ian, <i>c</i>ryolite, not
<i>ch</i>ryolite. As, however, the letter <i>c</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>
differs from <i>k</i>, which is the sound we assign to the
Greek <span class="greek">κ</span>, it may be allowable to use <i>k</i> in order to avoid
this confusion. Thus, as we have seen, poi<i>k</i>ilite has
been used, as well as pe<i>c</i>ilite. Even in common language
some authors write s<i>k</i>eptic, which appears to be
better than s<i>c</i>eptic with our pronunciation, and is
preferred by Dr. Johnson. For the same reason, namely,
to avoid confusion in the pronunciation, and also, in
order to keep in view the connexion with <i>cathode</i>, the
elements of an electrolyte which go to the anode and
cathode respectively may be termed the anion and
cat<i>h</i>ion; although the Greek would suggest catïon,
(<span class="greek">κατίον</span>).</p>
<p id="b4a21a6">6. The example of chemistry has shown that we
have in the terminations of words a resource of which
great use may be made in indicating the relations of
certain classes of objects: as sulphur<i>ous</i> and sulphur<i>ic</i>
acids; sulph<i>ates</i>, sulph<i>ites</i>, and sulph<i>urets</i>. Since the
introduction of the artifice by the Lavoisierian school,
it has been extended to some new cases. The Chlor<i>ine</i>,
Fluor<i>ine</i>, Brom<i>ine</i>, Iod<i>ine</i>, had their names put into
that shape in consequence of their supposed analogy:
and for the same reason have been termed Chlore, <span class="pagenum" id="page340">340</span>
Phlore, Brome, Iode, by French chemists. In like
manner, the names of metals in their Latin form have
been made to end in <i>um</i>, as Osmium, Palladium;
and hence it is better to say Platin<i>um</i>, Molybden<i>um</i>,
than Platin<i>a</i>, Molybden<i>a</i>. It has been proposed
to term the basis of Boracic acid Bor<i>on</i>; and those who
conceive that the basis of Silica has an analogy with
Boron have proposed to term it Silic<i>on</i>, while those
who look upon it as a metal would name it Silic<i>ium</i>.
Seleni<i>um</i> was so named when it was supposed to be a
metal: as its analogies are now acknowledged to be of
another kind, it would be desirable, if the change were
not too startling, to term it Sel<i>en</i>, as it is in German.
Phosph<i>orus</i> in like manner might be Phosph<i>ur</i>, which
would indicate its analogy with Sulph<i>ur</i>.</p>
<p>The resource which terminations offer has been applied
in other cases. The names of many species of
minerals end in <i>lite</i>, or <i>ite</i>, as Stauro<i>lite</i>, Aug<i>ite</i>.
Hence Adolphe Brongniart, in order to form a name
for a genus of fossil plants, has given this termination
to the name of the recent genus which they nearly
resemble, as Zam<i>ites</i>, from Zamia, Lycopod<i>ites</i> from
Lycopodium.</p>
<p>Names of different genera which differ in termination only
are properly condemned by
Linnæus<a id="fnanchor58-4" href="#note58-4"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a>; as
<i>Alsine</i>, <i>Alsinoides</i>, <i>Alsinella</i>, <i>Alsinastrum</i>; for there
is no definite relation marked by those terminations.
Linnæus gives to such genera distinct names, <i>Alsine</i>,
<i>Bufonia</i>, <i>Sagina</i>, <i>Elatine</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-4" href="#fnanchor58-4">58</a></span>
<i>Phil. Bot.</i> 231.
</div>
<p>Terminations are well adapted to express definite
systematic relations, such as those of chemistry, but
they must be employed with a due regard to all the
bearings of the system. Davy proposed to denote the
combinations of other substances with chlorine by
peculiar terminations; using <i>ane</i> for the smallest
proportion of Chlorine, and <i>anea</i> for the larger,
as Cupr<i>ane</i>, Cupr<i>anea</i>. In this nomenclature, common salt
would be <i>Sodane</i>, and Chloride of Nitrogen would be
<i>Azotane</i>. This suggestion never found favour. It was <span class="pagenum" id="page341">341</span>
objected that it was contrary to the Linnæan precept,
that a specific name must not be united to a
generic termination. But this was not putting the
matter exactly on its right ground; for the rules of
nomenclature of natural history do not apply to
chemistry; and the Linnæan rule might with equal
propriety have been adduced as a condemnation of
such terms as Sulphur<i>ous</i>, Sulphur<i>ic</i>. But Davy’s
terms were bad; for it does not appear that Chlorine
enters, as Oxygen does, into so large a portion of
chemical compounds, that its relations afford a key to
their nature, and may properly be made an element
in their names.</p>
<p class="end">This resource, of terminations, has been abused,
wherever it has been used wantonly, or without
a definite significance in the variety. This is the case in
M. Beudant’s Mineralogy. Among the names which
he has given to new species, we find the following
(besides many in <i>ite</i>), Scolexer<i>ose</i>, Opsim<i>ose</i>,
Exanthel<i>ose</i>, &amp;c.; Diacr<i>ase</i>, Panab<i>ase</i>, Neopl<i>ase</i>;
Neocl<i>ese</i>; Rhodo<i>ise</i>, Stibicon<i>ise</i>, &amp;c.;
Marcel<i>ine</i>, Wilhelm<i>ine</i>, &amp;c.;
Exit<i>ele</i>, and many others. In addition to other objections
which might be made to these names, their
variety is a material defect: for to make this variety
depend on caprice alone, as in those cases it does, is to
throw away a resource of which chemical nomenclature
may teach us the value.</p>
<p class="center" id="a22"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXII.</p>
<p><i>When alterations in technical terms become necessary, it
is desirable that the new term should contain in its form
some memorial of the old one.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have excellent examples of the advantageous
use of this maxim in Linnæus’s reform of botanical
nomenclature. His innovations were very extensive,
but they were still moderated as much as possible, and
connected in many ways with the names of plants then
in use. He has himself given several rules of nomenclature,
which tend to establish this connexion of the <span class="pagenum" id="page342">342</span>
old and new in a reform. Thus he says, ‘Generic
names which are current, and are not accompanied
with harm to botany, should be
tolerated<a id="fnanchor59-4" href="#note59-4"><span class="fnanchor">59</span></a>.’ ‘A
passable generic name is not to be changed for another,
though more apt<a id="fnanchor60-4" href="#note60-4"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a>’.
‘New generic names are not to
be framed so long as passable synonyms are at
hand<a id="fnanchor61-4" href="#note61-4"><span class="fnanchor">61</span></a>.’
‘A generic name of one genus, except it be superfluous,
is not to be transferred to another genus, though
it suit the other
better<a id="fnanchor62-4" href="#note62-4"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a>.’
‘If a received genus
requires to be divided into several, the name which
before included the whole, shall be applied to the most
common and familiar kind<a id="fnanchor63-4" href="#note63-4"><span class="fnanchor">63</span></a>.’
And though he rejects
all <em>generic</em> names which have not a Greek or Latin
root<a id="fnanchor64-4" href="#note64-4"><span class="fnanchor">64</span></a>,
he is willing to make an exception in favour of
those which from their form might be supposed to
have such a root, though they are really borrowed from
other languages, as <i>Thea</i>, which is the Greek for goddess;
<i>Coffea</i>, which might seem to come from a Greek
word denoting silence (<span class="greek">κωφός</span>); <i>Cheiranthus</i>,
which appears to mean hand-flower, but is really derived from
the Arabic <i>Keiri</i>: and many others.</p>

<p>As we have already said, the attempt at a reformation
of the nomenclature of Mineralogy made by Professor Mohs
will probably not produce any permanent
effect, on this account amongst others, that it has not
been conducted in this temperate mode; the innovations
bear too large a proportion to the whole of the
names, and contain too little to remind us of the
known appellations. Yet in some respects Professor
Mohs has acted upon this maxim. Thus he has called
one of his classes <i>Spar</i>, because <i>Felspar</i> belongs to it.
I shall venture to offer a few suggestions on this
subject of Mineralogical Nomenclature.</p>
<p>It has already been remarked that the confusion
and complexity which prevail in this subject render a
reform very desirable. But it will be seen, from the
reasons assigned under the <a href="#a9">Ninth</a> Aphorism, that no
permanent system of names can be looked for, till a <span class="pagenum" id="page343">343</span>
sound system of classification be established. The best
mineralogical systems recently published, however, appear
to converge to a common point; and certain
classes have been formed which have both a natural-historical
and a chemical significance. These Classes,
according to Naumann, whose arrangement appears
the best, are Hydrolytes, Haloids, Silicides, Oxides of
Metals, Metals, Sulphurides (Pyrites, Glances, and
Blendes), and Anthracides. Now we find;&mdash;that the
Hydrolytes are all compounds, such as are commonly
termed <i>Salts</i>;&mdash;that the Haloids are, many of them,
already called <i>Spars</i>, as <i>Calc Spar</i>, <i>Heavy Spar</i>, <i>Iron
Spar</i>, <i>Zinc Spar</i>;&mdash;that the <i>Silicides</i>, the most
numerous and difficult class, are denoted for the most part,
by single words, many of which end in <i>ite</i>;&mdash;that the
other classes, or subclasses, <i>Oxides</i>, <i>Pyrites</i>, <i>Glances</i>,
and <i>Blendes</i>, have commonly been so termed; as <i>Red
Iron Oxide</i>, <i>Iron Pyrites</i>, <i>Zinc Blende</i>;&mdash;while pure
metals have usually had the adjective <i>native</i> prefixed,
as <i>Native Gold</i>, <i>Native Copper</i>. These obvious features
of the current names appear to afford us a basis
for a systematic nomenclature. The Salts and Spars
might all have the word <i>salt</i> or <i>spar</i> included in their
name, as <i>Natron Salt</i>, <i>Glauber Salt</i>, <i>Mock Salt</i>; <i>Calc
Spar</i>, <i>Bitter Spar</i>, (Carbonate of Lime and Magnesia),
<i>Fluor Spar</i>, <i>Phosphor Spar</i> (Phosphate of Lime),
<i>Heavy Spar</i>, <i>Celestine Spar</i> (Sulphate of Strontian),
<i>Chromic Lead Spar</i> (Chromate of Lead); the <i>Silicides</i>
might all have the name constructed so as to be a
single word ending in <i>ite</i>, as <i>Chabasite</i> (Chabasie),
<i>Natrolite</i> (Mesotype), <i>Sommite</i> (Nepheline), <i>Pistacite</i>
(Epidote); from this rule might be excepted the <i>Gems</i>,
as <i>Topaz</i>, <i>Emerald</i>, <i>Corundum</i>, which might retain
their old names. The Oxides, Pyrites, Glances, and
Blendes, might be so termed; thus we should have
<i>Tungstic Iron Oxide</i> (usually called Tungstate of Iron),
<i>Arsenical Iron Pyrites</i> (Mispickel), <i>Tetrahedral Copper
Glance</i> (Fahlerz), <i>Quicksilver Blende</i> (Cinnabar),
and the metals might be termed <i>native</i>, as
<i>Native Copper</i>, <i>Native Silver</i>.</p>
<p>Such a nomenclature would take in a very large <span class="pagenum" id="page344">344</span>
proportion of commonly received appellations, especially
if we were to select among the synonyms, as is
proposed above in the case of <i>Glauber Salt</i>, <i>Bitter Spar</i>,
<i>Sommite</i>, <i>Pistacite</i>, <i>Natrolite</i>. Hence it might be
adopted without serious inconvenience. It would make
the name convey information respecting the place of
the mineral in the system; and by imposing this condition,
would limit the extreme caprice, both as to
origin and form, which has hitherto been indulged in
imposing mineralogical names.</p>
<p>The principle of a mineralogical nomenclature determined
by the place of the species in the system, has
been recognized by Mr. Beudant as well as Mr. Mohs.
The former writer has proposed that we should say
<i>Carbonate Calcaire</i>, <i>Carbonate Witherite</i>, <i>Sulphate
Couperose</i>, <i>Silicate Stilbite</i>, <i>Silicate Chabasie</i>, and so on.
But these are names in which the part added for the
sake of the system, is not incorporated with the common name,
and would hardly make its way into common use.</p>
<p>We have already noticed Mr. Mohs’s designations
for two of the Systems of Crystallization, the
<i>Pyramidal</i> and the <i>Prismatic</i>, as not characteristic. If it
were thought advisable to reform such a defect, this
might be done by calling them the <i>Square Pyramidal</i>
and the <i>Oblong Prismatic</i>, which terms, while they
expressed the real distinction of the systems, would be
intelligible at once to those acquainted with the Mohsian terminology.</p>
<p>I will mention another suggestion respecting the
introduction of an improvement in scientific language.
The term <i>Depolarization</i> was introduced, because it
was believed that the effect of certain crystals, when
polarized light was incident upon them in certain positions,
was to destroy the peculiarity which polarization
had produced. But it is now well known, that the
effect of the second crystal in general is to divide the
polarized ray of light into two rays, polarized in
different planes. Still this effect is often spoken of as
<i>Depolarization</i>, no better term having been yet devised.
I have proposed and used the term <i>Dipolarization</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page345">345</span>
which well expresses what takes place, and so nearly
resembles the elder word, that it must sound familiar
to those already acquainted with writings on this
subject.</p>
<p class="end">I may mention one term in another department of
literature which it appears desirable to reform in the
same manner. The theory of the Fine Arts, or the
philosophy which speculates concerning what is beautiful
in painting, sculpture or architecture, and other
arts, often requires to be spoken of in a single word.
Baumgarten and other German writers have termed
this province of speculation <i>Æsthetics</i>; <span class="greek">αἰσθάνεσθαι</span>, <i>to
perceive</i>, being a word which appeared to them fit to
designate the perception of beauty in particular. Since,
however, <i>æsthetics</i> would naturally denote the Doctrine
of Perception in general; since this Doctrine requires
a name; since the term <i>æsthetics</i> has actually been
applied to it by other German writers (as Kant); and
since the essential point in the philosophy now spoken
of is that it attends to Beauty;&mdash;it appears desirable
to change this name. In pursuance of the maxim now
before us, I should propose the term <i>Callæsthetics</i>, or
rather (in agreement with what was said in <a href="#page338">page</a> 338)
<i>Callæsthetic</i>, the science of the perception of beauty.</p>

ON SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE, FROM THE<br />

</div>
<hr class="two" />
<p>1. <span class="sc">Botany</span>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> nomenclature of Botany as rescued from confusion
by Linnæus, has in modern times been in some
danger of relapsing into disorder or becoming intolerably
extensive, in consequence of the multiplication of
genera by the separation of one old genus into several
new ones, and the like subdivisions of the higher groups,
as subclasses and classes. This inconvenience, and the
origin of it, have been so well pointed out by Mr. G.
Bentham<a id="fnanchor65-4" href="#note65-4"><span class="fnanchor">65</span></a>,
that I shall venture to adopt his judgment
as an Aphorism, and give his reasons for it.</p>
<div class="footnote end"><span class="label"><a id="note65-4" href="#fnanchor65-4">65</a></span> <i>Linnæan Society’s Proceedings</i>, vol. ii. p. 30 (June, 1857).
</div>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXIII.</p>
<p><i>It is of the greatest importance that the Groups which
give their substantive names to every included species should
remain large.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> will be recollected that according to the Linnæan
nomenclature, the genus is marked by a substantive, (as
<i>Rosa</i>), and the species designated by an adjective added
to this substantive, (as <i>Rosa Alpina</i>); while the natural
orders are described by adjectives taken substantively,
(as <i>Rosaceæ</i>), But this rule, though it has been
universally assented to in theory, has often been deviated
from in practice. The number of known species
having much increased, and the language of Linnæus
and the principles of Jussieu having much augmented
the facilities for the study of affinities, botanists have
become aware that the species of a genus and the genera
of an order can be collected into intermediate groups <span class="pagenum" id="page347">347</span>
as natural and as well defined as the genera and orders
themselves, and names are required for these subordinate
groups as much as for the genera and orders.</p>
<p>Now two courses have been followed in providing
names for these subordinate groups.</p>
<p>1. The original genera (considering the case of genera
in the first place) have been preserved, (if well founded);
and the lower groups have been called <i>subgenera</i>, <i>sections</i>,
<i>subsections</i>, <i>divisions</i>, &amp;c.: and the original names
of the genera have been maintained for the purpose of
nomenclature, in order to retain a convenient and stable
language. But when these subordinate groups are so
well defined and so natural, that except for the convenience
of language, they might be made good genera,
there are given also to these subordinate groups,
substantive or substantively-taken adjective names. When
these subordinate groups are less defined or less natural,
either no names at all are given, and they are distinguished
by figures or signs such as *, **, or § 1, § 2,
&amp;c. or there are given them mere adjective names.</p>
<p>Or, 2, To regard these intermediate groups between
species and the original genera, as so many independent
genera; and to give them substantive names, to be used
in ordinary botanical nomenclature.</p>
<p>Now the second course is that which has produced
the intolerable multiplication of genera in modern
times; and the first course is the only one which can
save botanical nomenclature from replunging into the
chaos in which Linnæus found it. It was strongly
advocated by the elder De Candolle; although in the
latter years of his life, seeing how general was the
disposition to convert his subgenera and sections into
genera, he himself more or less gave in to the general
practice. The same principle was adopted by Endlichen,
but he again was disposed to go far in giving
substantive names to purely technical or ill-defined
subsections of genera.</p>
<p>The multiplication of genera has been much too
common. Botanists have a natural pride in establishing
new genera (or orders); and besides this, it is felt
how useful it is, in the study of affinities, to define and <span class="pagenum" id="page348">348</span>
name all natural groups in every grade, however numerous
they may be: and in the immense variety of language
it is found easy to coin names indefinitely.</p>
<p>But the arguments on the other side much preponderate.
In attempting to introduce all these new
names into ordinary botanical language, the memory is
taxed beyond the capabilities of any mind, and the original
and legitimate object of the Linnæan nomenclature is
wholly lost sight of. In a purely scientific view
it matters little if the Orders are converted into Classes
or Alliances, the Genera into Orders, and the Sections
or Subsections into Genera: their relative importance
does not depend on the names given to them, but on
their height in the scale of comprehensiveness. But
for language, the great implement without which science
cannot work, it is of the greatest importance, as our
Aphorism declares, That the groups which give their
substantive names to every species which they include,
should remain large. If, independently of the inevitable
increase of Genera by new discoveries, such old
ones as <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Begonia</i>, <i>Arum</i>, <i>Erica</i>, &amp;c. are divided
into 10, 20, 30, or 40 independent Genera, with names
and characters which are to be recollected before any
one species can be spoken of;&mdash;if Genera are to be
reckoned by tens of thousands instead of by thousands;&mdash;the
range of any individual botanist will be limited
to a small portion of the whole field of the sciences.</p>
<p>And in like manner with regard to Orders, so long
as the number of Orders can be kept within, or not
much beyond a couple of hundred, it may reasonably
be expected that a botanist of ordinary capacity shall
obtain a sufficient general idea of their nature and
characters to call them at any time individually to his mind
for the purpose of comparison: but if we double the
number of Orders, all is confusion.</p>
<p>The inevitable confusion and the necessity of maintaining
in some way the larger groups, have been perceived
by those even who have gone the furthest in
lowering the scale of Orders and Genera. As a remedy
for this confusion, they propose to erect the old genera
into independent orders, and the old orders into classes <span class="pagenum" id="page349">349</span>
or divisions. But this is but an incomplete resumption
of the old principles, without the advantage of the old
nomenclature.</p>
<p>And it will not be asserted, with regard to these new
genera, formed by cutting up the old ones, that the new
group is better defined than the group above it: on the
contrary, it is frequently less so. It is not pretended
that <i>Urostigma</i> or <i>Phannacosyce</i>, new genera formed
out of the old genus <i>Ficus</i>, are better defined than the
genus <i>Ficus</i>: or that the new genera which have lately
been cut out of the old genus <i>Begonia</i>, form more natural
groups than <i>Begonia</i> itself does. The principle
which seems to be adopted in such subdivisions of old
genera is this: that the lowest definable group above a
species is a genus. If we were to go a step further,
every species becomes a genus with a substantive name.</p>
<p>It ought always to be recollected that though the
analytical process carried to the uttermost, and
separating groups by observation of differences, is necessary for
the purpose of ascertaining the facts upon which botany
or any other classificatory science is based, it is
a judicious synthesis alone, associating individuals by the ties
of language, which can enable the human mind to take
a comprehensive view of these facts, to deduce from
them the principles of the science, or to communicate
to others either facts or principles.</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Comparative Anatomy</span>.</p>
<p>The Language of Botany, as framed by Linnæus, and
regulated by his Canons, is still the most notable and
successful example of scientific terminology which has
obtained general reception among naturalists. But the
Language of Anatomy, and especially of the Comparative
Anatomy of the skeleton, has of late been an object
of great attention to physiologists; and especially to
Mr. Owen; and the collection of terms which he has
proposed are selected with so much thought and care,
that they may minister valuable lessons to us in this
part of our subject.</p>
<p>There is, at first sight, this broad difference between
the descriptive language of Botany and of Comparative <span class="pagenum" id="page350">350</span>
Anatomy; that in the former science, we have comparatively
few parts to describe, (<i>calyx</i>, <i>corolla</i>, <i>stamen</i>,
<i>pistil</i>, <i>pericarp</i>, <i>seed</i>, &amp;c.): while each of these parts is
susceptible of many forms, for describing which with
precision many terms must be provided: in Comparative
Anatomy, on the other hand, the skeletons of many animals
are to be regarded as modifications of a common
type, and the terms by which their parts are described
are to mark this community of type. The terminology
of Botany has for its object <em>description</em>; the language
of Comparative Anatomy must have for its basis <em>morphology</em>.
Accordingly, Mr. Owen’s terms are selected
so as to express the analogies, or, as he calls them, the
<i>homologies</i> of the skeleton; those parts of the skeleton
being termed <i>homologues</i>, which have the same place in
the general type, and therefore ought to have the same
name.</p>
<p>Yet this distinction of the basis of botanical and
anatomical terminology is not to be pushed too far.
The primary definitions in botany, as given by Linnæus,
are founded on morphological views; and imply
a general type of the structure of plants. These are his
definitions (<i>Phil. Bot.</i> Art. 86).<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Calyx</span>, <i>Cortex</i> plantæ in Fructificatione præsens.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Corolla</span>, <i>Liber</i> plantæ in Flora præsens.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Stamen</span>, Viscus pro Pollinis præparatione.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Pistillum</span>, Viscus fructui adherens pro Pollinis receptione.<br />
&emsp;<span class="sc">Pericarpium</span>, Viscus gravidum seminibus, quæ matura dimittit.</p>
<p>But in what follows these leading definitions, the
terms are descriptive merely. Now in Comparative
Anatomy, an important object of terms is, to express
what part of the type each bone represents&mdash;to answer
the question, <i>what</i> is it? before we proceed, assuming
that we know what it is, to describe its shape. The
difficulty of this previous question is very great when
we come to the bones of the head; and when we assume,
as morphology leads us to do, that the heads of all
vertebrated animals, including even fishes, are
composed of homologous bones. And, as I have already <span class="pagenum" id="page351">351</span>
said in the History (b. xvii. c. 7), speaking of Animal
Morphology, the best physiologists are now agreed that
the heads of vertebrates may be resolved into a series
of vertebræ, homologically repeated and modified in
different animals. This doctrine has been gradually
making its way among anatomists, through a great
variety of views respecting details; and hence, with
great discrepancies in the language by which it has
been expressed. Mr. Owen has proposed a complete
series of terms for the bones of the head of all vertebrates;
and these names are supported by reasons which
are full of interest and instruction to the physiologist,
on account of the comprehensive and precise knowledge
of comparative osteology which they involve; but they
are also, as I have said, interesting and instructive to
us, as exemplifying the reasons which may be given for
the adoption of words in scientific language. The reasons
thus given agree with several of the aphorisms
which I have laid down, and may perhaps suggest a
few others. Mr. Owen has done me the great honour
to quote with approval some of these aphorisms. The
terms which he has proposed belong, as I have already
said, to the <i>Terminology</i>, not to the <i>Nomenclature</i> of
Zoology. In the latter subject, the Nomenclature (the
names of species) the binary nomenclature established
by Linnæus remains, in its principle, unshaken, simple
and sufficient.</p>
<p>I shall best derive from Mr. Owen’s labours and reflexions
some of the instruction which they supply with
reference to the Language of Science, by making
remarks on his terminology with reference to such
aphorisms as I have propounded on the subject, and others
of a like kind.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen, in his <i>Homologies of the Vertebrate
Skeleton</i>, has given in a Tabular Form his views of
the homology of the bones of the head of vertebrates,
and the names which he consequently proposes for each
bone, with the synonyms as they occur in the writings
of some of the most celebrated anatomical philosophers,
Cuvier, Geoffroy, Hallmann, Meckel and Wagner,
Agassiz and Soemmering. And he has added to this
Table his reasons for dissenting from his predecessors <span class="pagenum" id="page352">352</span>
to the extent to which he has done so. He has done
this, he says, only where nature seemed clearly to refuse
her sanction to them; acting upon the maxim (our
<a href="#a10">Aphorism X</a>.) that new terms and changes of terms
which are not needed in order to express truth, are to
be avoided. The illustrations which I have there given,
however, of this maxim, apply rather to the changes in
nomenclature than in terminology; and though many
considerations apply equally to these two subjects, there
are some points in which the reasons differ in the two
cases: especially in this point:&mdash;the names, both of
genera and of species, in a system of nomenclature, may
be derived from casual or arbitrary circumstances, as I
have said in <a href="#a13">Aphorism XIII</a>. But the terms of a scientific
terminology ought to cohere as a system, and therefore
should not commonly be derived from anything
casual or arbitrary, but from some analogy or connexion.
Hence it seems unadvisable to apply to bones
terms derived from the names of persons, as <i>ossa
wormiana</i>; or even from an accident in anatomical
history, as <i>os innominatum</i>.</p>
<p class="end">It is further desirable that in establishing such a
terminology, each bone should be designated by a single
word, and not by a descriptive phrase, consisting of
substantive and adjective. On this ground Mr. Owen
proposes <i>presphenoid</i> for <i>sphenöide anterieur</i>. So also
<i>prefrontal</i> is preferred to <i>anterior frontal</i>,
and <i>postfrontal</i> to <i>posterior frontal</i>.
And the reason which he
gives for this is worthy of being stated as an Aphorism,
among those which should regulate this subject.
I shall therefore state it thus:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXIV.</p>
<p><i>It is advisable to substitute definite single names
for descriptive phrases as better instruments of thought.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> will be recollected by the reader that in the case of
the Linnæan reform of the botanical nomenclature of
species, this was one of the great improvements which
was introduced.</p>
<p>Again: some of the first of the terms which Mr. Owen
proposes illustrate, and confirm by their manifest claim <span class="pagenum" id="page353">353</span>
to acceptance, a maxim which we stated as <a href="#a22">Aphorism
XXII.</a>: namely,
When alterations in technical terms become necessary,
it is desirable that the new term should contain
in its form some memorial of the old one.</p>
<p>Thus for ‘basilaire,’ which Cuvier exclusively applies
to the ‘pars basilaris’ of the occiput, and which
Geoffroy as exclusively applies (in birds) to the
‘pars basilaris’ of the sphenoid, Mr. Owen substitutes the term
<i>basioccipital</i>.</p>
<p>Again: for the term ‘suroccipital’ of Geoffroy, Mr.
Owen proposes <i>paroccipital</i>, to avoid confusion and false
suggestion: and with reference to this word, he makes
a remark in agreement with what we have said in the
discussion of <a href="#a21">Aphorism XXI.</a>: namely, that the combination
of different languages in the derivation of words,
though to be avoided in general, is in some cases admissible.
He says, ‘If the purists who are distressed by
such harmless hybrids as “mineralogy,” “terminology,”
and “mammalogy,” should protest against the combination
of the Greek prefix to the Latin noun, I can
only plead that servility to a particular source of the
fluctuating sounds of vocal language is a matter of taste:
and that it seems no unreasonable privilege to use such
elements as the servants of thought; and in the interests
of science to combine them, even though they come
from different countries, when the required duty is best
and most expeditiously performed by their combination.’</p>
<p>So again we have illustrations of our <a href="#a12">Aphorism XII.</a>,
that if terms are systematically good they are not to be
rejected because they are etymologically inaccurate. In
reference to that bone of the skull which has commonly
been called <i>vomer</i>, the ploughshare: a term which
Geoffroy rejected, but which Mr. Owen retains, he says,
‘When Geoffrey was induced to reject the term <i>vomer</i>
as being applicable only to the peculiar form of the bone
in a small portion of the vertebrata, he appears not to
have considered that the old term, in its wider application,
would be used without reference to its primary
allusion to the ploughshare, and that becoming, as it <span class="pagenum" id="page354">354</span>
has, a purely arbitrary term, it is superior and preferable
to any partially descriptive one.’</p>
<p>Another condition which I have mentioned in <a href="#a20">Aphorism XX.</a>,
as valuable in technical terms is, that they
should be susceptible of such grammatical relations as
their scientific use requires.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, one of the grounds of the Aphorism
which we have already borrowed from Mr. Owen, that
we are to prefer single substantives to descriptive
phrases. For from such substantives we can derive
adjectives, and other forms; and thus the term becomes,
as Mr. Owen says, <em>a better instrument of thought</em>.
Hence, he most consistently mentions it as a recommendation
of his system of names, that by them the
results of a long series of investigations into the special
homologies of the bones of the head are expressed
in simple and definite terms, <em>capable of every requisite
inflection</em> to express the proportion of the parts.</p>
<p>I may also, in reference to this same passage in Mr.
Owen’s appeal in behalf of his terminology, repeat what
I have said under <a href="#a10">Aphorism X.</a>: that the persons who
may most properly propose new scientific terms, are those
who have much new knowledge to communicate: so
that the vehicle is commended to general reception by
the value of what it contains. It is only to eminent
discoverers and profound philosophers that the authority
is conceded of introducing a new system of terms; just
as it is only the highest authority in the state which has
the power of putting a new coinage into circulation.
The long series of investigations of which the results are
contained in Mr. Owen’s table of synonyms, and the
philosophical spirit of his generalizations, entitles him to a
most respectful hearing when he appeals to the Professors
and Demonstrators of Human Anatomy for an unbiassed
consideration of the advantages of the terms
proposed by him, as likely to remedy the conflicting
and unsettled synonymy which has hitherto pervaded
the subject.</p>
<p class="end">There is another remark which is suggested by the
works on Comparative Anatomy, which I am now considering.
I have said in various places that Technical <span class="pagenum" id="page355">355</span>
Terms are a necessary condition of the progress of a science.
But we may say much more than this: and the
remark is so important, that it deserves to be stated as
one of our Aphorisms, as follows:</p>
<p class="center" id="a25"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXV.</p>
<p><i>In an advanced Science, the history of the Language of
the Science is the history of the Science itself.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">I have</span> already stated in previous Aphorisms (<a href="#a8">VIII.</a>
and <a href="#a11">XI.</a>) that Terms must be constructed so as to
be fitted to enunciate general propositions, and that
Terms which imply theoretical views are admissible for
this purpose. And hence it happens that the history of
Terms in any science which has gone through several
speculative stages, is really the history of the
generalizations and theories which have had currency
among the cultivators of the science.</p>
<p>This appears in Comparative Anatomy from what we
have been saying. The recent progress of that science
is involved in the rise and currency of the Terms which
have been used by the anatomists whose synonyms Mr.
Owen has to discuss; and the reasons for selecting among
these, or inventing others, include those truths and
generalizations which are the important recent steps of the
science. The terms which are given by Mr. Owen in his
table to denote the bones of the head are good terms, <em>if</em>
they <em>are</em> good terms, because their adoption and use is
the only complete way of expressing the truths of homology:
namely, of that Special Homology, according to
which all vertebrate skeletons are referred to the human
skeleton as their type, and have their parts designated
accordingly.</p>
<p>But further: there is another kind of homology which
Mr. Owen calls <i>General</i> Homology, according to which
the primary type of a vertebrate animal is merely a series
of vertebræ; and all limbs and other appendages are
only developements of the parts of one or another of the
vertebræ. And in order to express this view, and in
proportion as the doctrine has become current amongst <span class="pagenum" id="page356">356</span>
anatomists, the parts of vertebræ have been described by
terms of a degree of generality which admit of such an
interpretation. And here, also, Mr. Owen has proposed
a terminology for the parts of the vertebræ, which
seems to convey more systematically and comprehensively
than those of preceding writers the truths to
which they have been tending. Each vertebra is composed
of a <i>centrum</i>, <i>neurapophysis</i>, <i>parapophysis</i>,
<i>pleurapophysis</i>, <i>hæmaphysis</i>, <i>neural spine</i> and
<i>hæmal spine</i>, with certain exogenous parts.</p>
<p>The opinion that the head, as well as the other parts
of the frame of vertebrates, is composed of vertebræ, is
now generally accepted among philosophical anatomists.
In the <i>History</i> (<i>Hist. I. S.</i> b. xvii. c. 7, sect. 1), I have
mentioned this opinion as proposed by some writers;
and I have stated that Oken, in 1807 published a ‘Program’
<i>On the signification of the bones of the Skull</i>, in
which he maintained, that these bones are equivalent to
four vertebræ: while Meckel, Spix, and Geoffroy took
views somewhat different. Cuvier and Agassiz opposed
this doctrine, but Mr. Owen has in his <i>Archetype and
Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton</i> (1848), accepted
the views of Oken, and argued at length against the
objections of Cuvier, and also those of Mr. Agassiz.
As I have noted in the last edition of the <i>History of
the Inductive Sciences</i> (b. xvii. c. 7), he gives a Table in
which the Bones of the Head are resolved into four vertebræ,
which he terms the Occipital, Parietal, Frontal
and Nasal Vertebræ respectively: the neural arches of
which agree with what Oken called the Ear-vertebra, the
Jaw-vertebra, the Eye-vertebra, and the Nose-vertebra.</p>
<p>Besides these doctrines of <i>Special Homology</i> by which
the bones of all vertebrates are referred to their
corresponding bones in the human skeleton, and of <i>General
Homology</i>, by which the bones are referred to the parts
of vertebræ which they represent, Mr. Owen treats of
<i>Serial Homology</i>, the recognition of the same elements
throughout the series of segments of the same skeleton;
as when we shew in what manner the arms correspond
to the legs. And thus, he says, in the head also, the
<i>basioccipital</i>, <i>basisphenoid</i>,
<i>presphenoid</i> and <i>vomer</i> are <span class="pagenum" id="page357">357</span>
homotypes with the <i>centrums</i> of all succeeding vertebræ.
The <i>excoccipitals</i>,<i> alisphenoids</i>, <i>orbitosphenoids</i>,
and <i>prefrontals</i>, are homotypes with the <i>neurapophyses</i>
of all the succeeding vertebræ. The <i>paroccipitals</i>,
<i>mactoids</i> and <i>postfrontals</i>, with the <i>transverse processes</i>
of all the succeeding vertebræ: and so on. Perhaps
these examples may exemplify sufficiently for the general
reader both Mr. Owen’s terminology, and the intimate
manner in which it is connected with the widest
generalizations to which anatomical philosophy has yet been
led.</p>
<p class="end">The same doctrine, that the history of the Language
of a Science is the history of the Science, appears also
in the recent progress of Chemistry; but we shall be
better able to illustrate our Aphorism in this case by
putting forward previously one or two other Aphorisms
bearing upon the history of that Science.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXVI.</p>
<p><i>In the Terminology of Science it may be necessary to
employ letters, numbers, and algebraical symbols.</i></p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Mineralogy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">I have</span> already said, in <a href="#a15">Aphorism XV.</a>, that
symbols have been found requisite as a part of the
terminology of Mineralogy. The <i>names</i> proposed by
Haüy, borrowed from the crystalline laws, were so
inadequate and unsystematic that they could not be
retained. He himself proposed a <i>notation</i> for crystalline forms,
founded upon his principle of the derivation of such forms
from a <i>primitive</i> form, by <i>decrements</i>, on its <i>edges</i>
or its <i>angles</i>. To denote this derivation he took
the first letters of the three syllables to
mark the faces of the <i>PriMiTive</i> form, <i>P</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>T</i>; the
vowels <i>A</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>O</i> to mark the angles; the consonants
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, &amp;c. to mark the edges; and numerical
exponents, annexed in various positions to these letters,
represented the law and manner of derivation. Thus
when the primitive form was a cube, <sup>1</sup><sub><i>B</i></sub>
represented the result of a derivation by a
decrement of one row <span class="pagenum" id="page358">358</span>
on an edge; that is, a rhombic octahedron;
and <sup>1</sup><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>P</i> represented
the combination of this octahedron with
the primitive cube. In this way the pentagonal
dodecahedron, produced by decrements of 2 to 1
on half the edges of the cube, was represented by
<i>B</i>² <sup>½</sup><sub><i>C</i></sub> <i>G</i>² ²<i>G</i></p>
<p>Not only, however, was the hypothesis of primitive
forms and decrements untenable, but this notation
was too unsystematic to stand long. And when Weiss
and Mohs established the distinction of Systems of
Crystallography<a id="fnanchor66-4" href="#note66-4"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a>,
they naturally founded upon that
distinction a notation for crystalline forms. Mohs had
several followers; but his algebraical notation so
barbarously violated all algebraical meaning, that it was
not likely to last. Thus, from a primitive rhombohedron
which he designated by <i>R</i>, he derived, by a
certain process, a series of other rhombohedrons, which
he denoted by <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>R</i> + 1,</span>
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>R</i> + 2,</span>
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>R</i> &minus; 1,</span> &amp;c.; and then, by
another mode of derivation from them, he obtained
forms which he marked as <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<i>R</i> + 2)²,</span>
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<i>R</i> + 2)³,</span> &amp;c. In
doing this he used the algebraical marks of addition
and involution without the smallest ground; besides
many other proposals no less transgressing mathematical
analogy and simplicity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note66-4" href="#fnanchor66-4">66</a></span>
<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xv. c. 4.
</div>
<p>But this notation might easily suggest a better. If
we take a primitive form, we can generally, by two
steps of derivation, each capable of numerical measure,
obtain any possible face; and therefore any crystalline
form bounded by such faces. Hence all that we need
indicate in our crystalline laws is the primitive form,
and two numerical exponents; and rejecting all
superfluity in our symbols, instead of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<i>R</i> + 2)³</span>
we might write 2 <i>R</i> 3. Nearly of this kind is the notation of
Naumann. The systems of crystallization, the octahedral
or tessular, the rhombic, and the prismatic, are
marked by the letters <i>O</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>P</i>; and from these are
derived, by certain laws, such symbols as</p>
<p class="center eq">  3 <i>O</i> ½, ∞ <i>R</i> 2, ½ <i>P</i> 2,  <span class="pagenum" id="page359">359</span></p>
<p class="noind eq">which have their definite signification flowing from
the rules of the notation.</p>
<p>But Professor Miller, who has treated the subject
of Crystallography in the most general and symmetrical
manner, adopts the plan of marking each crystalline
plane by <i>three</i> numerical indices. Thus in the
Octahedral System, the cube is {100}; the octahedron
is {111}; the rhombic dodecahedron is {011}; the
pentagonal dodecahedron is π {012}; where π indicates
that the form is not <i>holohedral</i> but <i>hemihedral</i>,
only half the number of faces being taken which the
law of derivation would give. This system is the
most mathematically consistent, and affords the best
means of calculation, as Professor Miller has shown;
but there appears to be in it this defect, that though
an essential part of the scheme is the division of
crystalline forms into Systems,&mdash;the Octahedral,
Pyramidal, Rhombohedral and Prismatic,&mdash;this division
does not at all appear in the notation.</p>
<p>But whatever be the notation which the crystallographer
adopts, it is evident that he must employ
some notation; and that, without it, he will be unable
to express the forms and relations of forms with which
he has to deal.</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Chemistry</span>.</p>
<p>The same has long been the case in Chemistry.
As I have stated elsewhere<a id="fnanchor67-4" href="#note67-4"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a>,
the chemical nomenclature
of the oxygen theory was for a time very useful
and effective. But yet it had defects which could not
be overlooked, as I have already stated under <a href="#a2">Aphorism II.</a>
The relations of elements were too numerous, and their
numerical properties too important, to
be expressed by terminations and other modifications
of words. Thus the compounds of Nitrogen and
Oxygen are the Protoxide, the Deutoxide, Nitrous
Acid, Peroxide of Nitrogen, Nitric Acid. The systematic
nomenclature here, even thus loosely extended,
does not express our knowledge. And the Atomic
Theory, when established, brought to view numerical <span class="pagenum" id="page360">360</span>
relations which it was very important to keep in
sight. If <i>N</i> represents Nitrogen and <i>O</i> Oxygen, the
compounds of the two elements just mentioned might
be denoted by <i>N</i> + <i>O</i>, <i>N</i> + 2<i>O</i>,
<i>N</i> + 3<i>O</i>, <i>N</i> + 4<i>O</i>, <i>N</i> + 5<i>O</i>.
And by adopting a letter for each of the elementary
substances, all the combinations of them might be expressed in this manner.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-4" href="#fnanchor67-4">67</a></span>
<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xiv. c. 6.
</div>
<p>But in chemistry there are different orders of combination.
A salt, for instance, is a compound of a
base and an acid, each of which is already compound.
If <i>Fe</i> be iron and <i>C</i> be carbon, <i>Fe</i> + <i>O</i>
will be the protoxide of iron, and <i>C</i> + 2<i>O</i> will be carbonic acid; and
the carbonate of iron (more properly carbonate of
protoxide of iron), may be represented by</p>
<p class="center eq">  (<i>Fe</i> + <i>O</i>) + (<i>C</i> + 2<i>O</i>)</p>
<p class="noind eq">where the brackets indicate the first stage of composition.</p>
<p>But these brackets and signs of addition, in complex
cases, would cumber the page in an inconvenient degree;
and oxygen is of such very wide occurrence, that
it seems desirable to abridge the notation so far as it
is concerned. Hence Berzelius
proposed<a id="fnanchor68-4" href="#note68-4"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a>
that in the first stage of composition the oxygen should be expressed
by dots over the letter; and thus the carbonate of iron
would be <i>Ḟe</i> + <i>C̈</i>. But Berzelius
further introduced into his notation indexes such as
in algebra denote involution to the square, cube, &amp;c.
Thus <i>Cu</i> being copper, the sulphate of copper is represented
by <i>S⃛</i>²<i>C̈u</i>. This notation, when first proposed,
was strongly condemned by English chemists, and
Berzelius’s reply to them may be taken as stating the
reasons in favour of such notation. He
says<a id="fnanchor69-4" href="#note69-4"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a>, ‘We
answer to the opponents, that undoubtedly the matter
may be looked at in various lights. The use
of Formulæ has always, for a person who has not
accustomed himself to them, something repulsive; but
this is easy to overcome. I agree with my opponent, <span class="pagenum" id="page361">361</span>
who says that nothing can be understood in a Formula
which cannot be expressed in words; and that if the
words express it as easily as the Formula, the use of
the latter would be a folly. But there are cases in
which this is not so; in which the Formula says in a
glance what it would take many lines to express in
words; and in which the expression of the Formula is
clearer and more easily apprehended by the reader
than the longer description in words. Let us examine
such a Formula, and compare it with the equivalent
description in words. Take, for example, crystallized
sulphate of copper, of which the Formula is</p>
<p class="center eq">  <i>C̈u</i><i>S⃛</i>² + 10<i>H</i>²&thinsp;<i>O</i>.</p>
<p class="noind eq">Now this Formula expresses the following propositions:<br />
&emsp;‘That the salt consists of one atom of copper-oxide
combined with 2 atoms of sulphuric acid and with 10
atoms of water; that the copper-oxide contains two
atoms of oxygen; and that the sulphuric acid contains
3 atoms of oxygen for one atom of sulphur; that its
oxygen is three times as much as that of the oxide;
and that the number of atoms of oxygen in the acid is
6; and that the number of atoms of oxygen in the
water is 10; that is, 5 times the number in the oxide;
and that finally the salt contains, of simple atoms, 1
copper, 2 sulphur, 20 hydrogen, and 18 oxygen.</p>

<i>Jahresbericht</i>, 1824, p. 119.
</div>
<p>‘Since so much is expressed in this brief Formula,
how very long would the explanation be for a more
composite body, for example, Alum; for which the
Formula is</p>
<p class="center eq">  <i>K̈</i>&thinsp;<i>S⃛</i>² + 2<i>A⃛l&thinsp;S⃛</i>³
+ 48<i>H</i>²&thinsp;<i>O</i>.</p>
<p class="noind eq">It would take half a page to express all which this
Formula contains.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps it may be objected that it is seldom that
any one wants to know all this at once. But it might
reasonably be said in reply, that the peculiar value of
the Formula consists in this, that it contains answers
to all the questions which can be asked with regard
to the composition of the body. <span class="pagenum" id="page362">362</span></p>
<p>‘But these Formulæ have also another application,
of which I have sometimes had occasion to make use.
Experiments sometimes bring before us combinations
which cannot be foreseen from the nomenclature, and
for which it is not always easy to find a consistent
and appropriate name. In writing, the Formula may
be applied instead of a Name: and the reader understands
it better than if one made a new name. In
my treatise upon the sulphuretted alkalies I found
Degrees of Sulphur-combination, for which Nomenclature
has no name. I expressed them, for example,
by <i>KS</i><sup>6</sup>, <i>KS</i><sup>8</sup>, <i>KS</i><sup>10</sup> and I believed
that every one understood what was thereby meant. Moreover, I found
another class of bodies in which an electro-negative
sulphuretted metal played the part of an Acid with
respect to an electro-positive sulphuretted metal, for
which a whole new nomenclature was needed; while
yet it were not prudent to construct such a nomenclature,
till more is known on the subject. Instead of
new names I used formulas; for example,</p>
<p class="center eq">  <i>KS</i>² + 2<i>As S</i>³,</p>
<p class="noind eq">instead of saying the combination of 2 atoms of Sulphuret
of Arsenic containing 3 atoms of Sulphur,
with one atom of Sulphuret of Potassium (Kali) with
the least dose of sulphur.’</p>
<p>Berzelius goes on to say that the English chemists
had found themselves unable to find any substitutes
for his formulæ when they translated his papers.</p>
<p>Our English chemists have not generally adopted
the notation of oxygen by dots; but have employed
commas or full stops and symbols (, or . and +), to
denote various degrees of union, and numerical indices.
Thus the double sulphate of copper and potash
is <i>Cu O</i>, <i>SO</i><sub>3</sub> + <i>KO</i>, <i>SO</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>What has been said is applicable mainly to inorganic
bodies (as salts and
minerals)<a id="fnanchor70-4" href="#note70-4"><span class="fnanchor">70</span></a>.
In these bodies there
is (at least according to the views of many intelligent
chemists) a <em>binary</em> plan of combination, union taking <span class="pagenum" id="page363">363</span>
place between <em>pairs</em> of elements, and the compounds
so produced again uniting themselves to other compound
bodies in the same manner. Thus, in the above
example, copper and oxygen combine into oxide of
copper, potassium and oxygen into potash, sulphur
and oxygen into sulphuric acid; sulphuric acid in its
turn combines both with oxide of copper and oxide
of potassium, generating a pair of salts which are
capable of uniting to form the double compound
<i>Cu O</i>, <i>SO</i><sub>3</sub> + <i>KO</i>, <i>SO</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>

</div>
<p>The most complicated products of inorganic chemistry
may be thus shown to be built up by this
repeated <em>pairing</em> on the part of their constituents.
But with organic bodies the case is remarkably different;
no such arrangement can here be traced. In
sugar, which is <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>C</i><sub>12</sub> <i>H</i><sub>11</sub> <i>O</i><sub>11</sub>,</span>
or morphia<a id="fnanchor71-4" href="#note71-4"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a>, which is
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>C</i><sub>35</sub> <i>H</i><sub>20</sub> <i>NO</i><sub>6</sub>,</span> the elements are
as it were bound together into a single whole, which can enter
into combination with other substances, and be thence discharged
with properties unaltered; the elements not being
obviously arranged in any subordinate groups. Hence
the symbols for those substances are such as I have
given above, no marks of combination being used.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-4" href="#fnanchor71-4">71</a></span>
Fownes’s <i>Chemistry</i>, p. 354.
</div>
<p>It is perhaps a consequence of this peculiarity that
organic compounds are <em>unstable</em> in comparison with
inorganic. In unorganic substances generally the elements
are combined in such a way that the most
powerful affinities are
satisfied<a id="fnanchor72-4" href="#note72-4"><span class="fnanchor">72</span></a>,
and hence arises a
state of very considerable permanence and durability.
But in an organic substance containing three
or four elements, there are often opposing affinities
nearly balanced, and when one of these tendencies by
some accident obtains a preponderance and the equilibrium
is destroyed, then the organic body breaks up
into two or more new bodies of simpler and more permanent constitution.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note72-4" href="#fnanchor72-4">72</a></span>
See <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xiv. c. 3.
</div>
<p>There is another property of many organic substances which
is called the <i>Law of Substitution</i>. The <span class="pagenum" id="page364">364</span>
Hydrogen of the organic substance may often be replaced
by Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, or some other
elements, without the destruction of the primitive
type or constitution of the compound so modified.
And this substitution may take place by several successive
steps, giving rise to a series of substitution-compounds,
which depart more and more in properties
from the original substance. This Law also gives rise
to a special notation. Thus a certain compound called
<i>Dutch liquid</i> has the elements
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>C</i><sub>4</sub> <i>H</i><sub>4</sub> <i>Cl</i><sub>2</sub>:</span>
but this substance is affected by chlorine (<i>Cl</i>) in obedience to the
law of substitution; one and two equivalents of hydrogen being
successively removed by the prolonged
action of chlorine gas aided by sunshine. The successive
products may be thus written</p>
<p class="center eq"> <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> <i>H</i><sub>4</sub> <i>Cl</i><sub>2</sub>;
<i>C</i><sub>4</sub> { <sup><i>H</i><sub>3</sub></sup><sub><i>Cl</i></sub> }  <i>Cl</i><sub>2</sub>;
<i>C</i><sub>4</sub> { <sup><i>H</i><sub>2</sub></sup><sub><i>Cl</i><sub>2</sub></sub> } <i>Cl</i><sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p class="end">Perhaps at a future period, chemical symbols, and
especially those of organic bodies, may be made more
systematic and more significant than they at present
are.</p>

than <i>C</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>O</i><sup>3</sup>, which
signify the square

words in a capricious and detached way: as
by taking fragments of words, and the like. I shall

some attempts which have more of a systematic character.</p>

<p>The discovery of such bases goes back to 1815.
The substance formerly called <i>Prussiate of Mercury</i>,
being treated in a particular manner, was resolved into
metallic mercury and <i>Cyanogen</i>. This substance, <i>Cyanogen</i>,
is, according to the older nomenclature, <i>Bicarburet
of Nitrogen</i>; but chemists are agreed that its
most convenient name is <i>Cyanogen</i>, proposed by its
discoverer, Gay-Lussac, in
1815<a id="fnanchor82-4" href="#note82-4"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a>.
The importance
of the discovery consists in this; that this substance
was the first compound body which was distinctly
proved to enter into combination with elementary substances
in a manner similar to that in which they
combine with each other.</p>

</div>
<p>The truth of our Aphorism (<a href="#a25">XXV.</a>) that in such a
science as chemistry, the history of the scientific nomenclature
is the history of the science, appears from this;
that the controversies with respect to chemical theories
and their application take the form of objections to the
common systematic names and proposals of new names
instead. Thus a certain compound of potassa, sulphur,
hydrogen, and oxygen, may be regarded either as <i>Hydrosulphate
of Potassa</i>, or as <i>Sulphide of Potassium in
solution</i>, according to different
views<a id="fnanchor83-4" href="#note83-4"><span class="fnanchor">83</span></a>. In some cases
indeed, changes are made merely for the sake of clearness.
Instead of <i>Hydrochloric</i> and <i>Hydrocyanic</i> acid,
many French writers, following Thenard, transpose the
elements of these terms; they speak of <i>Chlorhydric</i> and
<i>Cyanhydric</i> acid; by this means they avoid any ambiguity
which might arise from the use of the prefix
<i>Hydro</i>, which has sometimes been applied to compounds
which contain water<a id="fnanchor84-4" href="#note84-4"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>An incompleteness in chemical nomenclature was
further felt, when it appeared, from the properties of
various substances, that mere identity in chemical
composition is not sufficient to produce identity of
chemical character or
properties<a id="fnanchor85-4" href="#note85-4"><span class="fnanchor">85</span></a>.
The doctrine of <span class="pagenum" id="page368">368</span>
the existence of compounds identical in ultimate composition,
but different in chemical properties, was
termed <i>Isomerism</i>. Thus chemists enumerate the following
compounds, all of which contain carbon and
hydrogen in the proportion of single equivalents of
each<a id="fnanchor86-4" href="#note86-4"><span class="fnanchor">86</span></a>;&mdash;<i>Methylene</i>,

<p>I will, in the last place, propound an Aphorism
which has already offered itself in considering the
history of Chemistry<a id="fnanchor87-4" href="#note87-4"><span class="fnanchor">87</span></a>
as having a special bearing upon
that Science, but which may be regarded as the supreme

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aphorism</span> XXIX.</p>
<p><i>In learning the meaning of Scientific Terms, the history of
science is our Dictionary: the steps of scientific induction are
our Definitions.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is usual for unscientific readers to complain that
the technical terms which they meet with in books of
science are not accompanied by plain definitions such as
they can understand. But such definitions cannot be
given. For definitions must consist of words; and, in
the case of scientific terms, must consist of words which
require again to be defined: and so on, without limit.
<i>Elementary substances</i> in chemistry, for instance, what
are they? The substances into which bodies can be
<i>analysed</i>, and by the junction of which they are <i>composed</i>.
But what is <i>analysis</i>? what is <i>composition</i>? We
have seen that it required long and laborious courses of
experiment to answer these questions; and that finally
the balance decided among rival answers. And so it
is in other cases. In entering upon each science, we
come upon a new set of words. And how are we to learn <span class="pagenum" id="page369">369</span>
the meaning of this collection of words? In what other
language shall it be explained? In what terms shall we
define these new expressions? To this we are compelled
to reply, that we cannot translate these terms into any
ordinary or familiar language. Here, as in all other
branches of knowledge, the meaning of words is to be
sought in the progress of thought. It is only by going
back through the successful researches of men respecting
the <i>composition</i> and <i>elements</i> of bodies, that we can
learn in what sense such terms can be understood, so as
to convey real knowledge. In order that they may have
a meaning for us, we must inquire what meaning they
had in the minds of the authors of our discoveries. And
the same is the case in other subjects. To take the instance
of Morphology. When the beginner is told that
every group of animals may be reduced to an <i>Archetype</i>,
he will seek for a definition of Archetype. Such a definition
has been offered, to this effect: the Archetype of
a group of animals is a diagram embodying all the organs
and parts which are found in the group in such a relative
position as they would have had if none had attained
an excessive development. But, then, we are led
further to ask, How are we in each case to become
acquainted with the diagram; to know of what parts it
consists, and how they are related; and further;
What is the standard of <i>excess</i>? It is by a wide
examination of particular species, and by several successive
generalizations of observed facts, that we are led
to a diagram of an animal form of a certain kind, (for
example, a vertebrate;) and of the various ways,
excessive and defective, in which the parts may be developed.</p>
<p>This craving for definitions, as we have already said,
arises in a great degree from the acquaintance with geometry
which most persons acquire at an early age.
The definitions of geometry are easily intelligible by a
beginner, because the idea of space, of which they are
modifications, is clearly possessed without any special
culture. But this is not and cannot be the case in other
sciences founded upon a wide and exact observation of
facts. <span class="pagenum" id="page370">370</span></p>
<p class="end">It was formerly said that there was no Royal Road
to Geometry: in modern times we have occasion often
to repeat that there is no Popular Road&mdash;no road easy,
pleasant, offering no difficulty and demanding no toil,&mdash;to
Comparative Anatomy, Chemistry or any other of
the Inductive Sciences.</p>

<p class="center small end">CAMBRIDGE: PRINTED BY C. J. CLAY, M.A. AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.</p>
<div id="tnote">
<p class="center">Transcriber’s Notes</p>
<p>Whewell published the
first edition of the <i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i> in
1840 in two volumes, as a companion to the 1837 <i>History of the
Inductive Sciences</i>. Revised second editions of both works
appeared in 1847. The third editions saw a major reshaping of the
<i>Philosophy</i>: a two volume <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>
(1858 &ndash; in Project Gutenberg as #69093), <i>Novum Organon
Renovatum</i> (1858 &ndash; the present text, relying upon resources
kindly provided by the Internet Archive), and <i>On the Philosophy
of Discovery: chapters historical and critical</i> (1860 &ndash;
long since in Project Gutenberg’s collection: #5155). (The third
edition of the <i>History of the Inductive Sciences</i> is available in PG as #68693.)</p>
<p class="noind">Adaptations in this text</p>
<p>In the present text footnotes are numbered by Book and are placed
after the paragraph to which they attach; in the original, notes
were numbered by chapter. Page numbers appear in colour; where a
word was hyphenated across pages the number has been placed before
the word. Fractions have been transcribed as numerator ⁄  denominator;
the original usually has numerator over a line with denominator
below.</p>
<p>Some unusual symbols occur. On pages <a href="#page357">357</a> and 358, there are
italic letters with a number written above them. On two occasions
<i>B</i>  has a 1 above it, and once <i>C</i> has ½ above it. On page <a href="#page364">364</a>
a formula is written with two entries containing <i>H</i> on a line above
<i>Cl</i>. These superpositions have all been transcribed by superscripting the first
and subscripting the second item (with the result that the letters are printed
smaller than in the original). The other oddities have been captured in Unicode.</p>
<p>On pages <a href="#page152">152</a> and <a href="#page197">197</a>  Whewell uses
a raised dot as a decimal point and in
footnote <a href="#note26-3">26</a> of Book III. a comma. These have been replaced by a mid
dot.</p>
<p class="noind">Inductive Charts</p>
<p>At the end of Book II. (<a href="#page140a">p. 140</a>), Whewell included two very large inserts,
described in some detail in the Book itself. They were not captured by the scans
available in the Internet Archive. I was kindly provided with photographs of them.
Those charts were four times as wide as the normal page and a quarter as long.
In the html version they have been fairly accurately represented via tables;
but with up to 25 columns these tables will be very difficult to decipher on
small screens. In the text version, coded structure diagrams have been used,
which again utilise the full 70 spaces Project Gutenberg allows.</p>
<p class="noind">Corrections</p>
<p>Corrections are comparatively few. Apart from the silent ones,
they have been marked by dotted red underline, on mouse-over
revealing the nature of the change. Given the various editions, some
of the internal cross-references turn out to be obsolete or
erroneous:<br /> &emsp;<a href="#note11-3">note 11</a> in Book III.
The text reads B. viii. c. iii. but it refers actually to Book viii.
c. ii. article 3 in earlier editions and in the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>, cf. <a href="#a88">Aphorism
88</a> in Book I. of the present volume. Compare also <a
href="#a19">Aphorism 19</a> in this volume’s Book IV.<br /> &emsp;<a
href="#note58-3">notes 58 and 59</a> in Book III. refer to Book v.
c. i. For the present third edition they should have been aimed at
that chapter of the <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>.<br />
&emsp;On page <a href="#page252">252</a> we are told that the Work is about to conclude, as
the first edition did in a way (all the aphorisms were gathered
after Book XIII. [= our Book III.], followed by various appendices).
But we have Book IV. yet to come, plus some extra illustrations
regarding language and symbols in science.</p>
<p>(I might add that I have not checked the many references to Whewell’s
other related works. The errors here suggest one might need to take
them with a pinch of salt, and help from the browser’s search function.)</p>
<p class="end"> There
are some inconsistencies, notably in spelling, which have in
general not been adjusted; nor have Whewell’s unbalanced quotation
marks and positioning of footnote anchors been modernized. </p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
